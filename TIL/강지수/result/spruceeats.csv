It should take just 10 minutes or so, but you can turn down the heat to let it brew longer (the flavor gets better with time).\nTransfer to a large heatproof punch bowl.\nServe in coffee mugs or Irish coffee glasses, garnishing each drink with shaved nutmeg. Enjoy.\nTips\nIf you're using a punch bowl, make sure it's heat resistant so the glass doesn't crack.\nThis punch can also easily be heated in a slow cooker and left on low heat so it stays nice and warm. This is particularly nice if you add extra spices because it will fill your home with a warm and inviting aroma.\nSour mix is very easy to make at home because it's essentially a lemon-lime-flavored simple syrup. Dissolve 1 cup of sugar into 1 cup of boiling water, reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove it from the heat and stir in 1 cup each of lemon and lime juices, then let it cool before bottling.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile the recipe, as written, was designed to serve six 4-ounce servings, it can easily be doubled or tripled to fit any size crowd. Keep the ingredients in proportion as you increase the volume.\nInstead of sour mix, use 2 ounces lemon juice and 2 ounces simple syrup in the punch.\nAdd a few clove-studded orange slices and cinnamon sticks to the bowl for a little extra flavor and aroma. Both make excellent garnish options as well. You can add even more flavor by tossing a sachet of mulling spices into the punch as it warms.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Punch?\nBoth of the punch's liquors are bottled at 80 proof, which would make you think that it's going to be a strong punch. Yet, all of the nonalcoholic ingredients bring it down to a very mild 14 percent ABV (28 proof). It's just a little more potent than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bushmills-irish-punch-recipe-760226

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, remove from the heat, cover, and allow to cool slightly before transferring it to an infusion jar (at least 1 quart) with a tight lid.\nLet the wine steep for 24 hours, then strain the botanicals through a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.\nTransfer the strained wine back into the clean jar. Fortify it by adding the remaining 1 1/2 cups of wine along with the cream sherry. Seal and shake vigorously to combine.\nFunnel into a bottle, and store in the refrigerator. Drink straight or use in your favorite sweet vermouth cocktails.\nTips\nHomemade sweet vermouth is an excellent use for cheap wine, especially when perfecting your personal recipe. Look to the bottom shelf for pinot grigio that costs just a few dollars (you'll need one 750-milliliter bottle per batch).\nSweet sherry is also inexpensive, and cream sherry is readily available. Sweeter oloroso sherry is a good substitute and, for a really sweet alternative, try Pedro Xim?nez.\nThe botanicals are easiest to find online (particularly chamomile, gentian, juniper, and wormwood). Natural food markets may also carry them as well, and supermarkets stock the more common culinary herbs.\nHow to Store and Use\nVermouth does not have the shelf life of the liquors in your bar. Since it's made entirely with wine and skips the preservative powers of liquor, this homemade sweet vermouth will only keep for a month and should be refrigerated. However, there are plenty of uses, including chilled on its own as an ap?ritif before dinner (it's nice with dessert, too). It also pairs wonderfully with gin and whiskey in cocktails like the gin and it, Negroni, and Rob Roy.\nRecipe Variations\nCustomize the sweet vermouth by adjusting any of the botanicals. Taste the infused wine before fortifying it to get a sense of the base flavor; it will be slightly intense but should still have a good bitter, citrus, floral, and spice balance. When looking for substitutes, think about the botanical's main flavor properties. For instance, wormwood can be replaced with another bitter ingredient like dandelion root, and rosemary is an excellent alternative to lavender.\nFor an extra kick, add 1/2 to 1 cup of brandy to the blend.\nIf you want to try dry vermouth, use dry sherry (e.g., fino, manzanilla, or amontillado), and have fun creating a new botanical blend.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Sweet Vermouth?\nThe strength of sweet vermouth is similar to wine, and the homemade version is similar to commercial sweet vermouth. When made with the average pinot grigio and cream sherry, the fortified wine is around 13 percent alcohol by volume (ABV); adding a little brandy brings it up to 17 percent ABV.\nHomemade Cocktail Bitters""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/diy-sweet-vermouth-recipe-5218989

It is even the traditional garnish for a Pimm's Cup and has seen a resurgence in recent years. One of the easiest ways to bring it into drinks is through a homemade simple syrup.\nFor the syrup, choose young leaves and flowers. As the plant ages, the leaves become prickly. Not only are they not much fun to handle, but they also begin to lose the desired flavor. The syrup itself is as easy as making any other simple syrup, you're simply adding the herb for flavor.\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a small saucepan, combine 1 cup water and 1 cup sugar. Over medium heat, stir until the sugar is completely dissolved and bring to a slow boil. \nAdd 1/2 cup borage leaves and flowers and stir.\nReduce the heat, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes.\nRemove from the heat and allow to steep for at least one hour.\nStrain the borage from the syrup using a fine-mesh strainer. Bottle and refrigerate. It will be good for 2 weeks or more.\nMake the Borage Flower Ice Cubes\nSave your best borage flowers for the ice cubes. The flowers begin pink and develop a stunning blue-purple color as they mature. They look fabulous in this otherwise clear cocktail.\nMaking the floral ice is a two-step process because you'll give the flower a frozen foundation to rest on before filling the cube. You will just need to leave yourself enough time?a little over one day?to let them freeze completely.\nThis can be done with other edible flowers like pansies as well. Always be sure that your flowers are grown without chemical pesticides and fertilizers and actually safe to be eaten. Growing your own ensures that, though organic edible flowers may be found at some farmers markets and other outlets.\nFill ice cube trays halfway with distilled water and freeze.\nPlace a single borage flower on each cube.\nFill cubes the rest of the way with water and freeze.\nMake the Sparkling Borage Cocktail\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the gin, elderflower liqueur, borage syrup, and lime juice. Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nAdd borage flower ice cubes and top with club soda. Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than the club soda, you can use a similar lightly flavored soda or sparkling water. It's fantastic with Dry Sparkling's Lavender Soda; try other floral and herbal sodas as well. You could even add a splash of sparkling ros? wine.\nUse the borage syrup in similar lightly flavored cocktails and drinks. It adds a refreshing touch to the gin rickey and brings new life to a tall glass of lemonade.\nHow Strong Is the Sparkling Borage Cocktail?\nAs a martini-like drink, the sparkling borage cocktail is a relatively delicate one when it comes to the alcohol content. On the high side, it will be around 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof), though this will vary a bit. It's equivalent to similar drinks like the key lime pie martini.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sparkling-borage-cocktail-recipe-4134028

Allow this to rest for about 2 minutes.\nAdd Irish whiskey and 1 cup of hot water. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.\nPour equal amounts into shot glasses, leaving enough room for the second layer.\nRefrigerate for about 20 to 30 minutes.\nTips\nYour water does not need to be boiling, but it should be very hot in order to dissolve the gelatin.\nFor this first layer, you don\'t need the gelatin to set completely. However, you do want to have a semi-solid base because the second layer will still be warm. This may cause some of the brown gelatin to seep up into the green layer. It doesn\'t look bad, it just doesn\'t have the pure green color. \nMake the Green Gelatin Layer\nIf you\'re using the same bowl for this layer, wash it first. You may not be able to see it, but there\'s likely some gelatin left inside that\'s already setting up.\nPour the Irish cream liqueur into a bowl and add 1 envelope (1 tablespoon) of gelatin. Allow this to rest for about 2 minutes.\nAdd 1/2 cup of hot water and stir until the gelatin is dissolved.\nAdd about 4 drops of green food coloring and stir. Add more drops to intensify the green if you like.\nSlowly pour the green Irish cream gelatin on top of the partially set Guinness gelatin.\nRefrigerate for 2 to 3 hours or until completely set up.\nServing Options\nAs with any jelly shot, you can serve these in a variety of ways. \nDisposable plastic shot cups.\nLarge shot glasses?those with a large round bowl work great?or old-fashioned glasses.\nAs a sheet: Pour the gelatin layers into a flat dish or pan and cut them into squares once set.\nAbout the Gelatin\nEven though these shots fall into what are popularly called ""Jell-O shots"" that name is not entirely correct. That\'s because we\'re not using the Jell-O brand of gelatin (they don\'t make an unflavored gelatin). Instead, they should technically be called ""gelatin"" or ""jelly"" shots.\nYou will find unflavored gelatin from brands like Knox in most grocery stores. It is most often found in a box that contains four envelopes, each with 1/4 ounce or 1 tablespoon of gelatin. The total amount of gelatin needed for both layers is 1 ounce or 4 tablespoons.\nIf you\'re using a gelatin other than Knox, you may need to measure out the gelatin. \nMake These Shots on the Cheap\nThere\'s no need to buy a large bottle of Irish whiskey or cream or an entire six-pack of Guinness if you don\'t want to. Of course, stocking up your bar is not a bad idea, but you can save a little money with this recipe.\nTo make the exact recipe above, pick up one bottle of Guinness (many stores offer singles), one miniature bottle of Irish whiskey, and two minis of Irish cream. If the liquor store doesn\'t have minis of an Irish cream like Baileys, another cream like RumChata works just fine.\nHow Strong Are the Guinness & Green Shots?\nWe mixed three types of alcohol into these Jell-O shots, so you would think they\'d be pretty strong, right? Not necessarily because the largest volume comes from a 5.6 percent ABV stout. Plus, we match the total alcohol with just as much water, so the final shots are relatively tame.\n\nIf you were to use Guinness Extra Stout, Jameson Irish Whiskey, and Baileys Irish Cream, the Guinness & Green would have an alcohol content of around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).\n\nIn the world of party shooters, this is pretty mild. However, as we know from Jell-O shots, it\'s very easy to keep eating and you might be drunk before you know it. No matter how great they taste, don\'t forget that these have alcohol.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/guinness-and-amp-green-jelly-shot-recipe-4129357

Serve and enjoy.\nMore Tips for Making a Great Gillie Fix\nThe Scotch. Glenfiddich offers a wide variety of whiskies and the 14-Year-Old recommended in the Gillie Fix is one of the core expressions. This single malt scotch is aged 14 years. The Bourbon Barrel Reserve is a U.S. exclusive release that is aged in former bourbon barrels. It\'s one of the more affordable Glenfiddich bottlings, running just under $50 on average.\nIf you cannot find this particular Glenfiddich, try out one of the brand\'s other offerings. The 12-Year-Old is the youngest of the portfolio and would also make an excellent Gillie Fix.\nThe Peach Brandy. Fruit-flavored brandies, including peach, are making a big comeback after years of decline. There are a number of great options available today, particularly if you look to the small craft distilleries.\nFor the best peach brandy, choose one that does not include extra sugars or additives. Cheap ""brandies"" which are more liqueur than brandy have been the norm on liquor store shelves for a few decades. They\'re syrupy, low-proof, and, quite honestly, not your best option for any drink. Read the labels of peach brandy very carefully.\nYou can also look for peach whiskey or try your hand at infusing brandy with fresh peaches.\nThe Rum. FThe recommended rum for this recipe is Flor de Ca?a. The brand produces some nice rums in Nicaragua. There are a few 7-year-old options available, including Blanco Reserva, Gran Reserva, and Gran Reserva 90 proof. Any of these would be an excellent addition to your bar because they\'re all great for cocktails.\nHow Strong Is the Gillie Fix?\nThree distilled spirits go into the Gillie Fix and this does ramp up the alcohol content. If you were to use the recommended brands and measurements, you can expect this cocktail to be around 20 percent ABV (40 proof). It\'s neither the lightest nor the strongest cocktail in the bar, yet it\'s good to take it easy with this one.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/gillie-fix-cocktail-4137244

Most drinkers who tested the recipe prefer the 2:1 ratio of vanilla porter to hard cider, though you may enjoy it with a little more or less of either ingredient.\nThe quickest way to pour the two main ingredients is to hold one bottle in each hand. Pour simultaneously and slowly to minimize the foamy head. Stop pouring the cider about half way through and continue filling the glass with the vanilla porter. The beer and cider will mix the drink, so no stirring is needed.\nThis recipe can be made in a pitcher for quick service when you have a small group. It's also an easy one to pour when you're not in your bar or kitchen. Simply cut up some lemons and put your beer, cider, and raspberry juice in the cooler. It's a great drink for tailgating, camping, and picnics.\nThe Quickest Fresh Raspberry Juice\nYou can buy raspberry juice, though it can be difficult to find at times. If you have no luck at your local store, turn to fresh raspberries.\nThe easiest way to get fresh raspberry juice is to muddle about 10 to 15 berries in the bottom of each glass. This will add the pulp as well as the juice to your raspberry snakebite, but you'll also get the seeds. Some drinkers found they actually liked the fresh fruit because it leaves you with a little treat at the bottom of the beer. You can choose to drink the berry leftovers or just toss the last few sips.\nSeedless Raspberry Juice\nRaspberry seeds are very tiny and they are difficult to strain out of the juice. If you prefer a seedless raspberry juice, you have options. \nFirst of these is to turn to your electric juicer. It will make quick work of as many raspberries as you wish to juice. Most models do a fair job of eliminating or (at least) reducing the number of seeds. You can always strain it further through a couple layers of cheesecloth.\nIf you don't have a juicer, there is a manual solution. It takes a bit more work, so consider making a large batch of raspberry juice with at least 1 pound of berries to make it worth the effort.\nRaspberry juice can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week in a tightly sealed bottle. To make it last longer, freeze the juice in ice cube trays and bag them up once frozen. To make a drink, just pull out a cube or two.\nRaspberry Juice Without the Juicer\nThis method for making raspberry juice can work for both fresh and frozen berries. If frozen, you'll have to gauge how much water to add, though it shouldn't be enough to cover the entire chunk of berries. Start small and add more if necessary.\nIn a saucepan, cover rinsed raspberries with just enough water until the fruits just begin to float.\nSlowly bring the liquid to a boil and mash the berries with a large spoon, muddler, or (for maximum efficiency) a potato masher.\nAllow the mix to reach a boil once again, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes.\nRemove from the heat and allow to cool slightly for a few minutes.\nPlace a fine mesh strainer over top of a bowl and line it with cheesecloth.\nSlowly pour the raspberry liquid into the strainer, catching the juice in the bowl underneath.\nPick up the sides of the cheesecloth to form a small pouch and squeeze out as much juice as you can from the pulp.\nYour seedless raspberry juice is ready to drink. If you like, you can sweeten it slightly with simple syrup or sugar. It's also nice to add a squeeze of lemon or lime juice as well.\nHow Strong Is the Raspberry Snakebite?\nFirst of all, any drink with the name snakebite should be a warning that it may get you a little tipsy. Even though the beer-cider snakebites don't use liquor, the combination of the two 5 percent ABV beverages is a potent one. \n\nThe raspberry snakebite weighs in at around 4.5 percent ABV, which in theory is a pretty light drink. Yet, there's something about the mix that is surprisingly more intoxicating than drinking either the beer or cider alone. Take a little more caution and you should be good to go.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-snakebite-recipe-4145346

While you have many options, there are two specific brands that Arnold Palmer enjoyed in the drink.\nThe first is Ketel One Vodka, which is well known to have been Palmer\'s vodka of choice for many years. It\'s an exceptionally smooth vodka and it does make some excellent cocktails. However, it is not inexpensive and if you prefer to save some cash for a drink like this, there are some good and reasonably priced vodkas available. \nThe other ingredient is Haagen Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream. However, any good ice cream?preferably one made with real vanilla beans?will make a perfectly fine hummer.\nHow Strong Is a Bay Hill Hummer?\nMaybe it\'s the delicious taste or the possibility that people drink hummers too quickly, but it doesn\'t have the high alcohol content that its reputation suggests. It is one of the stronger blended cocktails, though. When made with two scoops of ice cream, it weighs in at 16 percent ABV (32 proof), or about half the strength of a martini. Of course, the more ice cream you add, the lighter it will become.\nThe Story of the Hummer Cocktail\nThe original hummer cocktail was created in 1967 by Jerome Adams at the Bayview Yacht Club in Detroit, Michigan. This is why it\'s also sometimes called the Detroit hummer.\nThe rum ice cream recipe was the result of the then-new bartender trying to mix up something different for customers. He admits in an interview with the Detroit Metro Times that he never thought it would be an international success. Adams says the drink was named the hummer because one customer commented that it\'s so strong that two will make you want to hum.\nAdams\' recipe mixes 1 1/2 ounce each rum and Kahl?a with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and ""a couple ice cubes."" It\'s a fantastic blended drink and can be adapted in many ways.\nRecipe Variations\nOver the years, the love for the hummer has inspired new recipes, including Palmer\'s favorite Bay Hill hummer. Other hummers include a banana split with banana and chocolate liqueurs; a candy cane with peppermint schnapps and cr?me de cacao; and a strawberry shortcake with strawberry liqueur and amaretto.\nYou can also transform some of your favorite sweet cocktails into a hummer by using the main liquors. For instance, a Creamsicle is made with triple sec, amaretto, and lemon ice cream with orange sherbet. A grasshopper uses cr?me de menthe and cacao, while a mocha hummer uses coffee liqueur and cr?me de cacao. Both of those use vanilla ice cream, as most hummers do.\nThe possibilities for creating hummers are endless. Keep your liquor pour to a total of 2 to 3 ounces and use 2 to 4 scoops of ice cream. With 4 scoops, you can easily get 2 short or 1 tall drink.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bay-hill-hummer-recipe-4147072

Add cream if you like.\nDry shake vigorously without ice.\nFill the shaker with ice and shake again for 30 seconds.\nStrain into a chilled sour or cocktail glass.\nDust with grated nutmeg. Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nMake Your Own Cinnamon Whiskey\nIt\'s important to distinguish cinnamon-infused whiskey with cinnamon-flavored whiskey liqueurs. The majority of ""cinnamon whiskey"" you can pick up at the liquor store falls into the latter category. They are sweetened?definition of a liqueur?and often flavored with artificial ingredients.\nWhile those are popular, this recipe is designed for a cinnamon-infused bourbon: straight bourbon flavored with real cinnamon. The good news is that this is one of the easiest infusions you can make. Anyone can do it and the flavor is much cleaner, giving you a pleasant bourbon background with hints of the real spice and no sweetness (that\'s the amaretto\'s job in the recipe).\nTo make cinnamon whiskey, simply place two whole cinnamon sticks into a mason jar filled with bourbon. Shake well and store in a cool, dark place for about three days, shaking it daily. After the third day, give your infusion a taste test. \nIf it\'s where you want it, remove the cinnamon sticks (strain or simply pull them out with tongs). If you want a little more cinnamon flavor, continue infusing until it reaches your desired taste. It may take three to seven days depending on the whiskey and the intensity you\'re going for.\nTip: You can place the cinnamon sticks directly in a bottle of whiskey. The problem is that the sticks swell as the cinnamon absorbs the whiskey, making them nearly impossible to remove through the thin bottleneck. Essentially, this gives you little to no control over the time and flavor of your infusion. You\'ll have to pour the whiskey out anyway or the cinnamon flavor will just keep getting stronger.\nWhich Whiskey?\nBourbon is a great choice here, but there\'s no reason you can\'t choose another style of whiskey. Irish whiskey would be an excellent option and some of the smooth Canadian blends are nice as well.\nRemember that bourbon, and whiskey in general, vary greatly. You\'ll have softer options and more robust ones. The brand you choose will determine the overall character of the infusion and the cocktail.\nYou may want to begin with something in the middle. Brands like Woodford Reserve and Maker\'s Mark are always good candidates for infusions because they\'re not too bold, nor too reserved. They take flavor well and are really nice in classically-styled drinks like Santa\'s flip.\nThe Importance of the Dry Shake\nThe key to mixing any cocktail with eggs is to remember the dry shake. This is particularly true with whole eggs and whites. It\'s a trick that often sets a great professional bartender\'s drinks apart from the rest.\nThe dry shake ensures that the egg is thoroughly mixed into the rest of the drink. It also does wonders for creating the signature foam all flip cocktails are known for. It adds less than a minute to your mixing time and it is worth every second of effort.\nKeep in mind that shaking egg drinks requires stamina: shake it until it hurts. The cocktail will be your reward for a little extra labor.\nHow Strong Is Santa\'s Whiskey Flip?\nSanta\'s whiskey flip is not the lightest cocktail you\'ll mix up during the holiday season, but it\'s not too strong, either. With an 80-proof bourbon and a 42-proof amaretto, you can expect this cocktail to be around 20 percent ABV (40 proof). That\'s average for drinks of this style.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/santas-whiskey-flip-cocktail-recipe-4148191

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nTo make two cocktails at one time, simply double the ingredients and blend away.\nRecipe Variations\nRecipes like the fros? are designed for experimentation, so let your imagination take you new places and explore all the possibilities.\nYou can make it using different flavors of vodka and juice. When doing so, continue to pour 3 ounces of wine and use 2 1/2 ounces total for all the other liquid ingredients.\nPlay around with various fruit vodkas and add complementary juices to your heart's desire. It's difficult to come up with a bad combination and you can spend the entire summer coming up with unique cocktails. For example, Van Gogh Vodka has another recipe for a tasty raspberry fros?. This one pours 1 1/2 ounces raspberry vodka with 1/2 ounce each lemon juice and simple syrup.\nA very fun idea for any fros? is to freeze the wine in ice cube trays and use the wine cubes instead of clear ice. It's a perfect way to preserve wine that's a little too old for drinking. The alcohol content of wine is low enough so the cubes should freeze up overnight. Not enough wine cubes? Simply make up the difference with regular ice.\nAs with many summer drinks?particularly blended ones?nothing says you can't add fresh fruit to this recipe. Berries, peaches, and melons would all make great additions to any fros? and almost any combination of fruits will work perfectly. Start out with no more than 1/2 cup of fresh fruit and cut larger fruits into 1-inch chunks. Adding volume might mean you'll end up with two drinks from a single blender. If you have too much for your prepared glass, stick the leftover in the freezer until you're ready for another round.\nAny of the varieties of fruit you add fresh or as juice to this drink can also be addedin the form of a liqueur. Melon liqueurs like Midori add flavor and a fun green color. Blue cura?ao will add hints of orange and make the drink blue. Strawberry, apricot, and raspberry liqueurs are other great options to try.\nYou can even add a rich background with a shot of amaretto or bring in a floral touch with a liqueur like St. Germain.\nYet another way to add a new layer of flavor to your fros? is with a flavored simple syrup. For the pomegranate-grapefruit combo, a nice herbal syrup like lavender or rosemary would be an excellent touch. Mint is a fun idea as well and, if you want to add a little spice, a splash of jalapeno syrup will do just fine.\nHow Strong Is a Pomegranate Grapefruit Fros??\nAs with most frozen drinks, this fros? is delightfully mild. On average, it should blend up to have an alcohol content around 8 percent ABV (16 proof).\n25 Best Blended Cocktails to Enjoy This Summer""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pomegranate-grapefruit-frose-recipe-4142285

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAvoid those last few sips of cold coffee by warming up your glass: Fill the mug with hot water while the coffee\'s brewing or heat a water-filled mug in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Dump out the water, then build your drink.\nYour average coffee from that reliable drip coffee maker will create a nice drink. Yet, a better Kentucky coffee can be made by beginning with a thicker, richer coffee.\nFor cocktails, consider brewing with a French press or use a pour-over method. You could also start with fresh-brewed espresso and add hot water (caff? Americano style) to increase the volume.\nWild Turkey 101 is a very bold bourbon, as are other higher-proof options like Knob Creek and Bulleit. The higher the alcohol content, the stronger the flavors; a rather desirable element in coffee drinks.\nIf you prefer a more subtle whiskey flavor, choose one that\'s bottled at 80 proof and known for a softer profile. Maker\'s Mark and Woodford Reserve are two well-known options. However, there are many excellent whiskeys in the category to explore, including those from small craft distilleries.\nRecipe Variations\nAs an alternative to Wild Turkey American Honey, Evan Williams Honey Reserve is a nice liqueur that also has a bourbon base. Likewise, consider using Barenj?ger, a rustic German honey liqueur that\'s equally impressive.\nFor a spiced twist, skip the honey liqueur and pour a cinnamon whiskey liqueur instead. Look for the ""Fire"" bottles from whiskey makers like Jim Beam or Jack Daniel\'s or pick up Fireball.\nInstead of liqueur, sweeten the Kentucky coffee with a teaspoon or two of raw or brown sugar. Just be sure to stir until the sugar dissolves.\nUse your favorite coffee creamer instead of whipped cream.\nHow Strong Is the Kentucky Coffee?\nThe strength of your Kentucky coffee is going to depend on the amount of coffee you add to the liquor. For instance, if you were to fill an 8-ounce coffee mug and use the two spirits in the recipe, the drink\'s alcohol content will be right around 9 percent ABV (18 proof). It\'s relatively mild and that\'s why it\'s so soothing.\nWhat Are Bourbon Coffee Beans?\nBourbon barrel-aged coffee beans are a trend in the coffee world. Offered by specialty coffee roasters, they make an excellent cup of coffee. By law, bourbon whiskey must be aged in new charred oak barrels. Since distilleries cannot reuse them, the barrels are often repurposed to age other spirits like rum and tequila. Coffee roasters caught on to the excess of bourbon barrels and started using them to age green coffee beans prior to roasting. Each has a different approach and the methods are often top-secret; some use a long aging process while others roll the beans in the barrel. Whatever the technique, the beans pick up the subtle oak, vanilla, char, and whiskey flavors trapped in the wood, and the flavors are enhanced when the beans are roasted. Though unlikely, if any alcohol is absorbed, only trace amounts will make it into the brewed coffee.\nThere is another type of Bourbon coffee. It comes from a specific variety of the Arabica coffee plant (Coffea Arabica var. Bourbon) that originated on the island of R?union, which was formerly known as Bourbon. No whiskey or barrels are involved; it\'s simply a special coffee bean that makes a great cup of java.\nWarm up With a Cozy Spiked Drink']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/kentucky-coffee-with-bourbon-and-honey-4119064

While you can, there is really no need to mix your best whiskey into this cocktail; if you have a favorite go-to Irish whiskey, it will work out just fine.\nAdding a few squeezes of lime provides just enough acid to help marry the sweet and spicy notes in this cocktail. Fresh lime juice is, as always, recommended because many of the bottled options are either too sweet or too tart and will throw off the drink\'s balance of flavors.\nThere are many great ginger beers available as well. The recent renewed interest in the Moscow mule has increased the options and made them easier to find.\nRecipe Variations\nTry mixing ginger beer with other styles of whiskey. Canadian whisky and American blends are known to have a similar smoothness to Irish whiskeys, making them good alternatives. Yet, if you\'re up for an adventure, give a few bourbons a try for a Kentucky mule, or really ramp up the drink\'s spiciness with a great rye whiskey.\nWhile you have a bottle of Irish whiskey, pair it with tonic water. It\'s a favorite style for a whiskey tonic and creates a tall drink with a drier profile that is as tantalizing as the ginger beer option.\nIs There Alcohol in Ginger Beer?\nToday, the majority of ginger beer is nonalcoholic or contains less than 0.5 percent alcohol so it can be classified as such. Its 19th-century English origins point to an alcoholic beverage that was brewed and fermented in a similar way to beer but with ginger rather than grains. These ""beers"" had an alcohol content around 11 percent ABV and there are a few modern ""hard"" ginger beers available. Many nonalcoholic commercial ginger beers are made in a similar way to ginger ale today?essentially a carbonated ginger soda that\'s less sweet and spicier than ginger ale.\nHow Strong Is the Irish Ale?\nAs is the case with many highball drinks, the Irish ale is a relatively tame cocktail. Though it uses a 2-ounce shot of whiskey, the ginger beer and a full glass of ice make up most of the volume, bringing it down to a smooth sipping strength. When made with an 80-proof Irish whiskey, the Irish ale weighs in right around 13 percent ABV (26 proof), which is similar to a glass of wine.\nSt. Patrick\'s Day Drinks & Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/irish-ale-cocktail-enjoy-your-whiskey-4119074

Stir well for about 20 seconds to relax and marry the flavors.\nFlame the orange peel over the drink, drop it in the glass, and serve.\nTips\n\nThis drink is often served on the rocks. For less dilution, go with a single large ice cube or ball. If you want the flavors to soften as you drink, use smaller cubes, which will melt faster.\nYou can also stir the drink in a mixing glass and strain it into a coupe glass, which is how it was originally served.\nTo flame an orange peel, light a long match or lighter in front of a large piece of peel (the outer peel should face the drink) as you squeeze it sharply. This expresses oils into the cocktail and creates tiny sparks.\nRecipe Variations\nTry different combinations of tequila and mezcal. A?ejo tequilas are an excellent option because they\'re aged longer than reposados and will have more oak notes. The taste of mezcal varies greatly from one brand to the next; it\'s dependent on the type of agave used and the production methods. As you explore these options, you may find it necessary to tweak the other ingredients:\n\nThe original Oaxaca old-fashioned uses Angostura aromatic bitters. Another excellent option is the slightly chile-spiced taste of mole bitters, and you can also try a combination of bitters. The subtle flavor accent can really transform this drink into something new.\nUse less agave nectar if you want a drink that\'s a little less sweet. You might find a bit more nectar is necessary with smokier mezcals.\nHow Strong Is the Oaxaca Old-Fashioned?\nThe average strength of both mezcal and tequila is 40 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 80 proof), though some are stronger. If you make the Oaxaca old-fashioned with two 80-proof spirits, the drink mixes up to about 29 percent ABV (58 proof). That\'s just a little weaker than drinking either spirit straight and why the drink is served short at a little under three ounces.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between Tequila and Mezcal?\nTequila and mezcal are both Mexican liquors distilled from maguey (or agave) plants. While they are similar, regulations for each spirit set standards for what agave varieties may be used, where and how they can be produced, and the various classes that appear on labels. Mezcal is regularly regarded as a more rustic liquor?though modern production is quite industrialized?and the harvested agave are traditionally roasted in earth or stone pits. This imparts the smokiness that mezcal is known for (some are not smoky) and a slight sweetness; neither of these is a flavor profile commonly found in tequila.\nWhat Does Reposado Mean?\n""Reposado"" translates from Spanish to mean ""rested."" It\'s a term used to classify certain tequilas and mezcals which spend a short amount of time aging in barrels. For both spirits, a reposado is aged between two months and one year.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis martini typically calls for ""1 barspoon"" of marmalade. That measurement can vary from one spoon to the next, though it\'s generally equivalent to a heaping teaspoon.\nIf the marmalade you\'re using has very fine bits of orange peel or is ""shredless,"" you can skip the muddle. Instead, stir it with the liquids until dissolved, then add ice and shake.\nTo fine-strain the cocktail, pour the drink through both your normal strainer and a fine-mesh strainer. It\'s not essential but ensures no marmalade bits make it into the glass.\nWho Invented the Breakfast Martini?\nThe breakfast martini was created in 1996 by Salvatore Calabrese while working at London\'s Library Bar in The Lanesborough hotel. His inspiration was the orange marmalade his wife insisted he eat for breakfast. The taste of the bitter preserves prompted him to take the jar to work and develop this recipe which is now enjoyed worldwide. It was not the first cocktail to use marmalade, though it is the most famous. In the 1930 ""Savoy Cocktail Book,"" Harry Craddock shared a marmalade cocktail recipe that also paired it with gin and lemon juice and is noted as ""especially suited to be a luncheon ap?ritif.""\nGin Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/breakfast-martini-recipe-5101607

One lime should yield the 1 ounce of juice needed in the recipe.\nLikewise, pour a premium triple sec, such as Cointreau. Other high-end orange liqueurs like Grand Marnier and orange cura?ao work as well.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many variations on the Italian margarita. Try one of these or tweak any of them to suit your personal taste:\nOne version replaces triple sec with fresh-squeezed orange juice. To make it, shake 1 1/2 ounces each of tequila and orange juice with 1 ounce each of amaretto and lime juice.\nAnother popular option uses a sour mix. For this version, shake 1 1/2 ounce of tequila, 1/2 ounce of triple sec, 1 ounce of amaretto, and 2 ounces of sour mix.\nServe any of these margaritas without ice in a well-chilled glass if you prefer. The Italian margarita is not the best candidate for a frozen cocktail.\nAdd a sugar or salt rim to the glass. For this drink, many people prefer either salt or a combination of sugar and salt.\nHow Strong Is an Italian Margarita?\nLike the original shaken margarita, the Italian margarita is not a light drink. Its alcohol content averages out at 22 percent ABV (44 proof).

Add a few extra ice cubes and blend again if the mix is too thin. Too thick? Add a little more wine. Taste and add more sugar or lemon juice if needed.\nPour into frozen stemmed glasses and garnish with strawberries.\nTips\nFor a blended fros?, use frozen strawberries because you'll need less ice and end up with a more flavorful cocktail. If you have fresh fruit, slice it up (eight to 10 large strawberries produce about two cups), lay them flat on a plate, and freeze them for an hour or two.\nCitrus juice adds a nice tang that brings balance to the sweet drink. While lemon juice is popular in a strawberry fros?, fresh lime juice is an excellent alternative.\nThe standard wine bottle is 750 milliliters, and the recipe requires only half a bottle because it's the perfect volume for the average blender. To use up the remaining wine, make a second batch and keep it frozen, or pour some of the chilled wine into the fros?-filled glasses.\nHow to Store\nYou can make fros? up to a few days in advance and keep it frozen. A hard-sided freezer container works great, and the fros? just needs to be forked until fluffy.\nYou can also pour it into a freezer-safe zip-top bag. When ready to serve, squish the bag to break the fros? into a slushy mix.\nFros? can also be reblended to chop it up; blend in a few ice cubes if it becomes too liquidy.\nRecipe Variations\nTo make fros? in advance without ice, blend an entire bottle of ros? wine with the recipe's strawberries (fresh or frozen), lemon juice, and sugar, and adjust it to taste. Pour the mix into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and freeze for at least four hours. The alcohol prevents it from freezing solid, and you can fork it into a fluffier slushie.\nIt is possible to make fros? without a blender using the freezer method and fresh fruit, though you'll still need to produce the strawberry pur?e. A food processor is the best alternative, a food mill will work, or you can muddle chopped strawberries into a juicy pulp. Mix the strawberry pur?e with the other ingredients, pour it into a plastic freezer bag, and lay it flat in the freezer for three to four hours, or until slushy.\nReplace some of the strawberries with other summertime fruits. Raspberries and watermelon will retain the pink color, while blackberries, blueberries, peaches, and other fruits are wonderful in fros?s as well.\nThe pomegranate grapefruit fros? takes another approach, replacing some of the wine with pomegranate vodka and grapefruit juice. Use it as inspiration for experiments with other fruity liquors and juices.\nHow Strong Is Fros??\nThe volume of the nonalcoholic ingredients affects the amount of alcohol in fros?. Ice dilutes the cocktail, so the quick blended version is only around 5 percent ABV, or about half the strength of the wine. If you skip the ice and opt for a wine-only freezer fros?, it will be a little stronger, weighing in around 8 percent ABV.\n25 Best Blended Cocktails to Enjoy This Summer""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/frose-recipe-5235421

The advantage of rolling is that none of the salt will drop into the drink and alter the taste.\nIf you're not sure that you'd like the rim, dress up only half the glass so you can sip from either side as you drink. Plain salt or sugar are good alternatives when you'd prefer to skip the spice.\nRecipe Variations\nAs with many margaritas, this one is excellent when frozen. Simply toss all of the ingredients into a blender with 1 cup of ice (about 5 or 6 average cubes) and blend until smooth. For more of a spiked watermelon slushy, use 2 cups of frozen watermelon cubes and skip the ice.\nMake a spicy watermelon margarita by adding 3 or 4 jalape?o slices to the muddle.

Jalape?o simple syrup can also be used; split it evenly with the triple sec.\nOther fruits that pair well with watermelon can be muddled in as well.

In cities such as Madrid and Barcelona, restaurants stir up large pitchers of sangria and sell them for high prices while those ""in the know"" enjoy a refreshing glass of tinto de verano without breaking the bank. \n\nTinto de verano has become so popular in Spain that it is sold already-made in cans. If you order it from a bar when visiting the country, be aware that you might receive this canned version; it doesn\'t necessarily taste bad, but it does not taste like the freshly made version. \nClassic Spanish Red Wine Sangria']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tinto-de-verano-spanish-wine-cocktail-recipe-3083126

Add the brown and white sugars and stir until completely dissolved.\nReduce the heat to a simmer. Add the vanilla extract, cardamom, cloves, allspice, star anise, and cinnamon stick.

Secure the lid.\nPlace the jar in the refrigerator. If you prefer to use a traditional canning method, process the jar in boiling water for 10 minutes, allow it to cool, then store in a cool, dark place such as a cupboard or pantry. Either way, let the brandied cherries rest for six weeks before using to allow the flavor to develop.\nTips\nPitting cherries is a messy affair, especially at the height of the cherry season when they're super juicy. Wear an apron or clothing you don't mind getting splashed with cherry juice. Have a damp cloth handy to wipe up the counter and to clean your hands.\nIf you want to leave the stem intact, use the tip of a vegetable peeler or paper clip to carefully pit the cherry from the bottom. It's preferable to trim the stem to half its size.\nStrain the cherry juice from the bowl of pits with a fine-mesh strainer held over the pitted cherries.\nWhether stored in the refrigerator or canned using the water bath, the unopened jar of cherries should keep for up to a year (until next cherry season).\nOnce opened, keep the jar of brandied cherries chilled in the refrigerator and enjoy them within a week. Use multiple smaller jars if you won't consume a full quart of cherries within that time.\nRecipe Variations\nUse 1 cup of white sugar alone or switch to raw sugar.\nUse a flavored brandy that will complement the cherries.

Any other kind of berry, such as raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and/or strawberries, would work much in the same way as cherries in this recipe.\nIf gin's not your thing, pour vodka if you prefer that for a fruity twist on the vodka tonic.\nHow Strong Is a Cherry Gin and Tonic?\nThe cherry gin and tonic is an easy to drink cocktail. Its alcohol content falls right in line around 12 percent ABV (24 proof) if you pour about 4 ounces of tonic.

Try clementines around the holidays, grapefruits if you would like something a little more sweet-sour, or swap out the apples for pears instead.\n\nIf you don't have Grand Marnier, which is a combination of triple sec and cognac liqueurs, you can use other orange-flavored liqueurs instead. Try either Cointreau, which is close in taste, or any triple sec. Consider experimenting with what you like, and add a touch cognac to replicate the Grand Marnier effect.\nHow to Store Sangria\nYou can mix sangria ahead of time and store it in the fridge until you're ready to serve it.

This gin has a softer profile than the traditional London dry gin that we're used to. It is less juniper-forward and has more focus on floral notes. It is a gin that vodka lovers will enjoy because it doesn't have that piney aspect that some drinkers find unappealing with gin. This profile also makes Nolet's the perfect base for the softer flavors of this sangria. It is a complement to the light, white fruits and that combination is what makes this recipe stand out.\nThe Grape Juice: Since we are going with a floral gin and a dry white wine, your average purple grape juice is not the best option for this recipe. Instead, look for white grape juice, which has a lighter flavor and is not as sweet as the darker options.\nHow Strong Is the Silver Sangria?\nNolet's is a higher-proof gin than average and is bottled at 47.6 percent ABV. If we use an 11 percent ABV wine in this sangria recipe, it has the alcohol content of around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).\nAs you can see, once we add the juice and soda to the mix, it is no stronger than the wine we used.

These pink wines come in a range of styles, from sweet to dry and the best for this particular recipe are the drier Ros?s. To find those, look for a wine from southern France, Spain, or Italy.\nAdd to the Citrus. Give your sangria a lively citrus character by building on the lime and soda. Do so by adding sliced lemon and lime to the mix. This brings in more color and heightens the citrus-infused flavors at the same time. \nFresh Strawberries Are Key. If it is summer and you're making this sangria, do yourself a favor and choose fresh strawberries. After all, the fruit is the signature flavor of the drink. There really is no good excuse for using frozen strawberries in any strawberry sangria recipe during berry season.\nPlay With Your Mint. There are many varieties of mint available and you can have a lot of fun with different mints in this recipe. Peppermint and spearmint are natural options, but if you have chocolate mint, pineapple mint, or any of those other unique mints in your garden, toss them in as well.

Among those, you will find that any of these varietals are an ideal starting point.\nA Muscat (or Moscato), complete with its fruity taste.\nA sweeter Riesling that is more like a dessert wine.\nA gew?rztraminer with its fabulous lychee-like profile.\nPassion Fruit Juice: Buy or DIY\nPassion fruit is, obviously, the star of this recipe and it\'s important that you treat it with the attention it deserves. You can either buy passion fruit juice or make your own from the fresh fruits.\nMake Fresh Passion Fruit Juice. The passion fruit is not one of the juiciest fruits around and it will take a lot of passion fruits to yield the 2 cups needed for this Sangria if you use straight juice. However, you can maximize the yield and enjoy fresh passion fruit with the help of your blender and a little water.\nPurple passion fruit is preferred for fresh consumption though golden passion fruit will be great as well. The fruit tastes similar to a guava and has juicy seeds like a pomegranate, which is the desired part of the fruit. Choose passion fruit that is soft and semi-squishy, but not yet brown (a sign of being over ripe).\nScoop the seedy pulp (avoid the white flesh) out of 5 to 6 very ripe passion fruits and place them in the blender.\nAdd about twice the volume of cold, distilled water and 1 tablespoon of sugar.*\nBlend well.\nStrain the pulp and seeds from the juice using a fine-mesh strainer or sieve over a large bowl. Press the pulp to release more of the juice and strain again if needed.\nAdd twice the volume of cold water, stir, and taste. \nAdd more water and sugar in small amounts until the juice is to your liking.\nOnce done, bottle it in a container with a tight seal and store in the refrigerator.\nThis method will yield more than enough juice for the sangria and leave you with extra to mix into other drinks. It\'s great in the morning when mixed with orange juice.\n*You can use an alternative sweetener for the juice but will need to adjust it to your taste. Agave nectar or honey would both be excellent options. It\'s best to avoid artificial sweeteners as many are too bitter for the sweet-sour fruit.\nBuy passion fruit juice. Straight passion fruit juice is admittedly difficult to find in the average grocery store because it\'s not as popular as pineapple, orange, or any of the other common juices. Many times, you can find passion fruit in a blended juice with other tropical fruits.

Serve and enjoy.\nA Note About Prairie Organic Vodka\nThis recipe is courtesy of Prairie Organic Vodka, and it is one of the top picks for organic vodka. It is corn-based and produced in Minnesota, with the grain sourced from a co-op of local organic farmers. Since the brand's launch in 2008, they've introduced a gin and cucumber vodka as well.\nThough Prairie Organic's original intention was that it's clear vodka be used, this cocktail is just a little bit more enjoyable with their cucumber vodka. The switch adds just a little more freshness to the drink and the flavor of the two garden ingredients in tandem is simply wonderful, a true fix for spring fever!\nChoosing the Best Peas\nThe freshness of your sugar snap peas is going to be key in making a great Green Giant cocktail. Look for peas that have a saturated pale green color and try snapping one. They should easily snap in half, not bend.\nStoring Peas\nStore the peas in a sealed plastic bag. They should be good for 4-5 days in the refrigerator.\nUnless you grow them yourself, sugar snap peas have a very short season. You can prolong your enjoyment of the Green Giant by blanching and freezing the peas. The process is quick and though it won't be exactly like fresh peas from the vine, they will retain enough of their fresh flavor to create a good drink.\nI wouldn't go longer than a month in the freezer because they do loose their flavor. Use older peas for food dishes and remember this recipe for next spring.\nHow Strong Is the Green Giant?\nThe Green Giant is the strength of the average cocktail. If we use a 15 percent ABV vermouth, then we can estimate it to be right around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). It's slightly stronger than the average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/green-giant-cocktail-with-peas-3890215

Garnish with a lime wheel and a sprig of rosemary and serve.\nTips\nSangria is best left to chill to marry the flavors. You can make this 24 hours in advance, but overnight is ample time. If you're in a pinch, give it at least two hours and serve it over ice.\nCarbonate your own water or read the labels on sparkling water to ensure it doesn't contain sugar (especially flavored water). Club soda and seltzer are usually sugar-free and good substitutes in this recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch to a dry white wine if you like. Chardonnay, pinot grigio, and Viognier are among the driest.\nAdd sweetness without sugar with a sugar-free syrup; stir in 1/4 cup and more if needed. You can use allulose monk fruit sweetener in place of sugar to make a quick simple syrup at home.\nSkip the grapefruit or switch to oranges or lemons. Other berries, particularly raspberries, are a good substitution for strawberries.\nAdd extra flavor by using an infused vodka. It's best to infuse your own because many commercially-flavored vodkas include sugar.\nLight rum is a good alternative to vodka, and brandy is a little darker but could work, too.\nHow Strong Is the Low-Sugar Sangria?\nEven with the vodka, this sangria recipe is equivalent to the average wine. After chilling, its alcohol content will fall around 12 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) when served without ice.\nWhich Wine Has the Least Sugar and Carbs?\nDry wines have less sugar than sweet wines because they have fewer residual sugars. You can cut the sugar in any sangria recipe with this single ingredient. Typically, you can get away with cheaper wines in sangria because of all the extra flavors, but those also tend to have more sugar. Spend a little more and use the recipe's recommendations for ros? and white wines. For a red wine sangria, select a bottle of cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, or syrah (or shiraz).\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lower-sugar-sangria-with-agave-nectar-3511039

Twist small pieces of foil into the shape of a dowel, about 10 inches long and the diameter of a drinking straw (the shape doesn't have to be perfect).\nWrap one piece of bacon around a foil dowel, spiraling down as you go and overlapping the previous layer of bacon.

Preheat the oven to 300 F and place the oven rack in the middle.\nZest the limes and oranges to produce about 2 tablespoons of each type of zest.\nIn a small baking tray, spread the citrus zest out on parchment paper. Dry in the oven for 5 minutes, toss, then dry for an additional 3 to 5 minutes if needed. Remove from the oven and let cool.\nUsing the parchment, transfer the zest to a cutting board and dice into finer pieces.\nIn a small bowl, add the kosher and sea salts, sugar (if using), and dried citrus zest. Mix with a fork until well combined.\nTransfer to a jar with a tight seal. Store at room temperature in a dry, dark place for up to 6 months.\nTo use the margarita salt, spoon a small portion into a shallow dish. Wet the rim of a glass with a citrus wedge, and roll it around in the flavored salt. Tap off any excess.\nMix the cocktail, strain it into the salt-rimmed glass, and enjoy.\nTips\nParchment paper is not necessary, but it makes it much easier to move around the fine pieces of zest.\nDepending on the fruit, the lime zest may dry faster than the orange. Don't worry about getting either brittle-dry; during storage, the salt will take care of any remaining moisture.\nMicroplane graters will produce a fine zest that may not need to be diced. The goal is that the zest roughly matches the salt grains.\nRecipe Variations\nCoarse salts are best for rimming glassware, and there are several types of specialty salt that are perfect for this recipe. Use flake sea salt if you like larger pieces on the rim, or substitute all or a portion of the sea salt with Himalayan pink sea salt. Do not use a table or iodized salt; it's too fine and salty.\nUse a single type of citrus zest rather than a blend.\nFor a little spice, add about 1/2 teaspoon of chile powder?ancho and chipotle peppers are excellent choices. You can also skip the citrus zest completely and make chile margarita salt.\nHow Do You Get Margarita Salt to Stick to the Rim?\nThoroughly wetting the rim is essential to get salt, sugar, or any other rimming ingredient to stick to the glass. Running a citrus wedge or slice around the rim is especially convenient if your drink includes fresh juice or a citrus garnish. Liqueurs and syrups work as well; pour a small amount in a dish and dip the rim. Whichever liquid you use, the key is to get the rim wet all the way around then roll it in the salt before it dries.\nCan Margarita Salt Be Used for Cooking?\nMargarita salt is typically reserved for drinks and doesn't make a good substitute for regular salt in food recipes. However, if you omit the sugar and don't use flake salt, this particular blend could work if you're cooking a dish that fits the salty-citrus flavor. Sprinkling it on fish filets, for instance, would add a nice flavor boost.\n9 Easy and Flavorful Margarita Recipes for Everyone""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/margarita-salt-recipe-5180625

The heavy canvas reduces ice melt, and you can quickly crush an entire tray of ice cubes by hitting them with a muddler or mallet.\nFor a slower melt, fill the glass with ice cubes.\nRecipe Variations\nPour a flavored rum if you like. Citrus, coconut, and vanilla rums are all excellent choices, while pineapple rum gives the strawberry mojito a tropical flare. Some drinkers like spiced rum in their mojitos, too.\nUse 1/2 to 1 ounce of simple syrup instead of the sugar. Or, go with raw sugar or your favorite sugar substitute.\nSwitch from club soda to sparkling wine.\nMint going bad? Make fresh mint last a little longer by placing it in a jar of water or hanging it up to dry (it will still work for mojitos). Alternatively, preserve it by making mint simple syrup and use that instead of fresh mint and sugar.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Mojito?\nIt's difficult to estimate the alcohol content of a drink like the strawberry mojito because the muddled fruit yields a varying amount of juice. On average, the drink should mix up to about 7 ounces, so it will fall in the 11 percent ABV (22 proof) range when made with 80-proof rum. That's similar to a glass of wine, only a lot more fun and definitely fruitier!\nHow Do You Muddle a Mojito Without a Muddler?\nA muddler is a valuable tool for cocktails and an inexpensive investment if you like mojitos, old-fashioneds, and other muddled cocktails. If you don't have one, look around your kitchen for a blunt, long-handled object. A wooden spoon is one of the best options, and a standard spoon or fork will work in a pinch. Other options include a pestle, tamper, meat tenderizer, or French-style rolling pin. You may need to press the fruit and herbs into the side of the glass, rather than the bottom. If muddling in a tall glass is a challenge, do it in a small bowl, then transfer the mix to the glass.\nWhat's the Difference Between a Mojito and a Daiquiri?\nWhile both are classic rum cocktails, a mojito is made with rum, sugar, lime, mint, and soda water, while a daiquiri is made with lime juice, sugar or simple syrup, and rum.

Fill the shaker with ice.\nShake vigorously for at least 30 seconds.\nStrain into an old-fashioned glass over crushed ice.\nGarnish with mango slices and a sprig of fresh mint (if using). Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFor this mai tai, use your favorite aged rum. The oakiness of barrel aging adds a nice depth of flavor to the fruity drink.\nConsider fresh-squeezed lime juice essential for any tropical drink, as bottled juices are often sweetened and sometimes unnaturally flavored. One-half of a large lime should yield enough juice for a single drink.\nCrushed ice is a signature for any mai tai, giving the drink a frostiness that ice cubes simply can't add. To quickly crush ice cubes, use a manual or electric ice crusher machine. A Lewis bag and mallet work as well but take a little more effort. You'll need about 1 cup of crushed ice per glass.\nRecipe Variations\nSpiced rum is a good alternative to aged rum, adding a little extra flavor to the mai tai.\nInstead of fresh mango, use 1 1/2 ounces of either mango rum or mango nectar or a combination of the two.\nBlueberries are excellent with mango; add a few blueberries to the muddle for a pop of color and sweet berry taste.\nFor a spicier twist, muddle a slice or two of jalape?o pepper with the mango and orgeat.\nWhen you want to make a pitcher of mango mai tais, it's best to use mango juice, nectar, or rum. For six to eight drinks, use 1 1/2 cups each of aged rum and the mango liquid of your choice, 1/2 cup each of cura?ao and lime juice, and 1/4 cup each of orgeat syrup and pineapple juice. Mix the ingredients in a small pitcher and keep it chilled. To serve, pour into glasses over crushed ice and garnish.\nWhat Can I Use in Place of Orgeat Syrup?\nOrgeat syrup is an almond-flavored syrup with a hint of orange flower water. The nonalcoholic mixer often appears in tropical cocktails and is a great sweetener in many rum drinks. If you don't have it, almond syrup or amaretto liqueur are good substitutes.\nHow Strong Is a Mango Mai Tai?\nThe amount of alcohol in the mango mai tai will depend on the strength of the rum you choose to pour. Using the average 80-proof rum, it mixes up in the 18 percent ABV (36 proof) range. This drink is a bit lighter than the original mai tai but is still a pretty strong cocktail.\nRum Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mango-mai-tai-recipe-5189264

Cover and simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat and let cool completely.\nStrain the mint from the syrup using a fine-mesh strainer.\nTransfer the mint syrup to an airtight bottle or jar, and keep it refrigerated.\nMake the Pitcher Mojito\nGather the ingredients.\nJuice 6 to 8 limes, straining out the pulp, to produce about 1 1/2 cups of juice.\nIn a pitcher, add the rum and 1 cup each of the mint syrup and lime juice. Add more syrup or juice to taste; make this base a little strong because it will be diluted with club soda. Keep chilled until needed.\nJust before you're ready to serve the mojitos, add the chilled club soda to the pitcher.\nPour the sparkling mojito mix into ice-filled glasses. Garnish each with a sprig of mint and lime slice.\nTips\nThe mint syrup can be stored in the fridge for up to two weeks.\nCombine the rum, mint syrup, lime juice a few hours in advance and keep it chilled until ready to serve.\nRecipe Variations\nTo make a pitcher of nonalcoholic mojitos, replace the rum with more club soda. This mocktail version is also excellent with a second sweeter soda like ginger ale or sparkling grape juice.\nGive your mojito pitcher an extra fruity touch. One easy way is to use flavored rum (coconut, mango, or any citrus fruit is excellent) as a substitute for all or part of the light rum. Alternatively, add sliced strawberries and whole blueberries or raspberries to the pitcher, and let them infuse the drink with flavor while it chills overnight.\nAnother option is to add mashed fruits (about one cup) or fruit juice (replacing 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the water) to the syrup. Any berry or melon pairs well with mint, and pomegranate is a fun option.\nHow Strong Is the Mojito Pitcher?\nThe nonalcoholic ingredients outweigh the rum in this pitcher mojito, so it's a relatively mild cocktail. When made with an 80-proof rum, the alcohol content falls around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). That's similar to a glass of wine, and the ice will dilute it a little more in the glass.\nWhat Kind of Rum Is Best in a Mojito?\nTraditionally, light rum is used in the mojito. It's probably the best choice when serving a group because its taste has a universal appeal that everyone will enjoy. However, aged rums make nice mojitos as well. Avoid spiced rums that contrast the lime and mint. Whatever style of rum you choose, mid-shelf brands tend to have a clean taste that will complement the mojito's freshness but won't blow your entertaining budget.\nCan I Use Vodka Instead of Rum in a Mojito?\nVodka is an excellent alternative to light rum in drinks like the mojito. The two liquors have similar profiles, though vodka's taste is more transparent.

Muddle gently to mix the flavors and dissolve the honey.\nAdd the light rum and mango nectar. Stir well.\nFill the glass with ice cubes and top with club soda.\nGarnish with a lime wheel or wedge, a sprig of fresh mint, and mango slice, if using.\nTips\nSince there's no fresh fruit to mash in this mango mojito and the mint is already torn, a muddler is not essential. Simply stir the lime, honey, and mint mixture very well if you don't have one.\nMojitos deserve a good rum that allows the fresh flavor to shine. A mid-range brand with a clean, smooth taste you would enjoy drinking straight is a reliable choice.\nRecipe Variations\nWhen you have fresh mango, cut about half a fruit into small chunks and add it to the glass with the lime juice and honey. Muddle this into a juicy pulp, then add the mint leaves and muddle just enough to infuse the sweetened fruit blend with the cool herbal flavor.\nAlternatively, use a store-bought or homemade mango pur?e as an equal substitute for the mango nectar. To turn the fresh fruit into a mango pur?e, process mango chunks in the blender until smooth.\nSwitch out the base liquor if you like. Mango rum will play up the mango flavor, while passion fruit or pineapple rum adds a complementary tropical fruit taste. Vodka works too, and citrus or vanilla vodka would be excellent flavor options.\nFor a mocktail, skip the rum and switch to a sweeter soda such as ginger ale. You can also replace the recipe's rum and lime juice with about two ounces of lime cordial, then top it with the soda of your choice.\nIncreasing the recipe to a pitcher is very easy. To make eight mojitos at once, for instance, squeeze the juice of one lime into the pitcher, add 1/4 cup honey, and a full sprig or two of mint. Mix well to dissolve the honey then stir in 1 1/2 cups each of rum and mango nectar. Top the pitcher with about 3 cups of club soda before serving, and serve the drinks over ice.\nHow Strong Is a Mango Mojito?\nRum is the only alcohol in the mango mojito, so it's a relatively light cocktail. The recipe creates a seven-ounce cocktail and, when made with the standard 80-proof rum, it mixes up to about 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That alcohol content falls right between beer and wine.\nWhat Alcohol Is Best for a Mojito?\nTraditionally, the Cuban mojito is made with light rum, and it's a great choice for any fruity variation on the cocktail. Some great mojitos are made with aged rums which impart a deeper flavor accented with a pleasant oakiness to the drink. And, many drinkers who are partial to vodka pour that instead.\nPineapple Mojito Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mango-mojito-recipe-5197855

Squeeze lemon juice over the pear flesh to prevent oxidation, which turns them brown.\nIn a large pitcher, add the pear slices, cranberries, and pomegranate arils.\nIn a separate pitcher or bowl, combine the wine, brandy, and cranberry juice. Taste the mixture and add the sugar for a sweeter base, if desired, stirring until the sugar is dissolved.\nPour the wine mixture over the fruits. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, though overnight is best to let the flavors meld.\nWhen it's time to serve, add the ginger beer to the pitcher, starting with 12 ounces and adding more to taste. Stir well after each addition.\nPour the sangria into glasses to serve, garnishing each with a sprig of rosemary and more fruits, if desired. Enjoy.\nTip\nChoose a dry white wine such as pinot grigio or sauvignon blanc for a balanced flavor.\nRemoving the arils from a pomegranate can be messy. Work over a plate or bowl rather than a cutting board because the juicy seeds can stain wood and other porous materials. Many grocery stores sell just the arils on their own, too?saving you the work.\nSome ginger beer is very spicy. Taste the sangria as you add it to find a good balance of flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nA sweet white wine will work well in this sangria, but you'll definitely want to skip the sugar.\nIf you prefer a softer profile, use ginger ale, club soda, or sparkling white wine as a substitute for the ginger beer. You can also use a combination of ginger beer and soda water.\nIt's easy to transform this into a red wine sangria: Choose your favorite dry red wine, switch to red pears and cranberry juice, and pour a regular brandy (apricot brandy is fun, too). Instead of ginger beer, use ginger ale or club soda.\nWhat Is Sangria Typically Made Of?\nSangria is a wine punch with Spanish origins. It can be traced back 2,000 years to when Romans first arrived on the Iberian Peninsula and the area's now-famous vineyards were planted. Though there is no single sangria recipe or rules to follow, most use a basic formula: a dry wine base accented with liquor (often brandy) and adorned with lots of seasonal fruits.\n\nRed wine sangrias are the most traditional, though white and ros? wines make excellent sangrias as well. Many recipes also include sugar, although juices, liqueurs, and syrups can be used to sweeten instead. Sangrias can be still or given a little sparkle with soda or wine, and rum is a popular alternative liquor.\nWhat Are the Juiciest Pears?\nAs this sangria rests in the fridge, the fruits add their flavor to the wine punch. While you can use any pear, the juicier varieties will contribute more flavor. For green pears, Anjou, Bartlett, Comice, and Concorde are excellent choices. Both Anjou and Bartlett are cultivated as red pears as well. To offset the tartness of the cranberries, the top picks for the Christmas sangria are Bartlett and Concorde pears because they are as sweet as they are juicy.\nHow Strong Is the Christmas Sangria?\nEstimating the alcohol content of sangria is always tricky because there are many variables involved. On average, it's going to be a little lighter than the wine you pour. This recipe, for example, mixes up to 8 percent ABV (16 proof) when made with a 12 percent ABV white wine.\nEnglish Christmas Punch""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/christmas-sangria-recipe-5087832

Whisk until it reaches a smooth, semi-thick consistency, about 3 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until needed.\nIn a warm mug, pour the cr?me de cacao and Irish cream.\nFill with freshly brewed hot coffee, leaving about 1/2 inch of room at the top. Stir well.\nTop the coffee with the minty cream.\nGarnish with green and red candy sprinkles. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe liqueur color doesn't matter when it's mixed with coffee. Use either dark or white cr?me de cacao or switch to your favorite chocolate liqueur.\nThe whipped cream will top two or three cups of coffee, and you can make more if you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to two days when covered; whip quickly before using. The cream is excellent on hot cocoa, too.\nTo ensure the most flavorful drink, brew a strong cup of coffee. French press, pour-over, and stovetop espresso brewers are excellent options for all coffee cocktails.\nKeep your drink warm longer by preheating the cup: Fill it with hot water while brewing the coffee or heat the water-filled cup in the microwave for 10 seconds. Discard the water just before building the cocktail.\nCan Cream Be Whipped With a Mixer?\nThis recipe relies on lightly whipped cream; don't worry about getting it perfect or forming peaks. If you prefer, make whipped cream as you would for dessert using an electric hand mixer or stand mixer. Some food processors have a whipping attachment as well.\nRecipe Variations\nUse peppermint schnapps or white cr?me de menthe to flavor the cream. Make it green with a drop of food coloring.\nMix the cr?me de menthe into whipped topping or canned whipped cream.\nSkip the mint and whip the cream with amaretto or vanilla liqueur. Spiced liqueurs like gingerbread (if you can find it) are excellent, too. Alternatively, use 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract.\nMake this drink nonalcoholic: Switch to chocolate syrup and coffee creamer for the base, then mix mint extract into the cream.\nHow Strong Is the Christmas Coffee?\nThe three liqueurs in this Christmas coffee are low in alcohol and volume. The size of your cup will determine how much coffee you pour and the drink's strength. It is strongest with 6 ounces of coffee, though that's still just 4 percent ABV (8 proof). It's a perfectly casual drink that's similar in strength to beer.\nWhich Alcohol Goes Best With Coffee?\nCoffee pairs well with various distilled spirits. Whiskey is a favorite, and it goes with this recipe's mint-chocolate taste. Irish whiskey is an excellent choice, though other blended whiskeys and bourbon work well, too. Rum is a good option for coffee cocktails with chocolate and nut liqueurs (e.g., amaretto, hazelnut) but doesn't fit particularly well with mint liqueur. You can even spike coffee with vodka. For this recipe and many others, vanilla and chocolate vodkas are delicious options.\n20 Festive Christmas Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spiked-christmas-coffee-recipe-5087829

Pulse to chop up the mix.\nAdd the rum, brandy, orgeat syrup, orange juice, and lemon juice. Blend until smooth.\nIn a scorpion bowl, pour the blended mixture over large pieces of ice.\nFill the reservoir in the middle of the bowl with 151-proof rum. Add fruit garnishes. Using a long lighter, light the rum on fire.\nExtinguish the flame and add four long straws. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAlways extinguish the flames before drinking.\nKeep all flammables away from the volcano (including paper umbrellas).\nDon't reach or lean over the bowl. Depending on the ambient light in the room, the alcohol flame can be nearly invisible and it's easy to forget that it's still on fire.\nFresh-squeezed citrus juices are going to create a better scorpion bowl. One orange will yield between 2 and 3 ounces of juice, so a few fruits should be enough. For the lemon, simply squeeze two halves directly into the blender.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can serve the scorpion bowl in a regular small punch bowl and skip the flaming rum.\nIt's also fun to serve in individual tiki mugs or cups. Fill each with ice, pour the mixture to fill, then garnish.\nA hollowed out half of a lime works as a reservoir alternative in both bowls and cups that don't have the built-in volcano. The trick is to balance it on a bed of ice so it rests securely and won't spill.\nTo make a slightly sweeter and pink punch, add 1 ounce of grenadine to the blender. It can also be used as a substitute for the orgeat, though 2 ounces should be enough.\nAdd 2 ounces of vodka or gin, or use either as a substitute for the brandy.\nUse whatever tropical fruit is in season as a substitute for the mango. Passion fruit, papaya, and even a banana can add a fun twist of flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Scorpion Bowl?\nA lot of factors can change the alcohol content of the scorpion bowl. Generally, however, it's a pretty mild punch. When made with 80-proof rum and brandy, it should weigh in somewhere around 12 percent ABV (24 proof), or about the same as a glass of wine. That's assuming you don't drink what's left of the 151 rum, of course.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/scorpion-bowl-recipe-4685141

If your bottle has been open and unrefrigerated for longer than a couple of months, it's time to replace it because the fortified wine does go stale over time.\nRecipe Variations\nA popular variation on the hanky panky pours 2 ounces of gin, 1 ounce of sweet vermouth, and 1/4 ounce of Fernet-Branca. This results in a drier cocktail that some people may enjoy a little more.\nSome drinkers prefer adding a dash of fresh orange juice. It is not original to the cocktail but was added around 2010, according to Simon Difford. It's a welcome addition that brightens up the mix. Try it with and without to see what you think.\nFernet is actually a style of Italian amaro (bitter) and Branca a brand name; it's also the best-known. You can substitute another fernet, though it will be slightly different as the 27 herbs, spices, and roots in Branca are part of a secret recipe. Do try others, such as Fernet Leopold Highland Amaro from Leopold Bros., as they also create a fascinating hanky panky.\nHow Strong Is a Hanky Panky Cocktail?\nLike all liquor-only martinis, the hanky panky does not play around on the alcohol content.

The result is a slightly lighter drink with a great balance of flavor\n(Recipe from Leo DeGroff)\nReviving the Legendary Long Island Ice Tea\nMany cocktail enthusiasts have decried the merits of the Long Island Iced Tea (or LIIT, for short) in recent years. It\'s true that this famous drink has been little more than a quick way to get drunk without drinking a bunch of shots. And yet, there are still many LIIT fans out there, and if you are one of them, then this is a recipe you will want to taste.\nWhere the Long Island often goes wrong is that bartenders will use the full line up of liquor in the bar\'s ""well"" to create it. This recipe does just the opposite, by-passing the cheap stuff and opting instead for some of the best brands in their respective categories. The fact that the ""tasteless"" vodka has been replaced by a flavorful Irish whiskey makes it all the better.\nHow Strong Is the Tully Tea?\nHighballs are always difficult to calculate when it comes to measuring the final alcohol content, because there are many factors involved. Each bartender has their own pouring style, highball glasses vary by a couple of ounces, and the amount of ice used can vary greatly.\n\nLet\'s assume that 1 ounce of soda is used to fill the glass. We know the proof of all of the liquors: the rum, tequila and whiskey are each 80 proof, and Oxley Gin weighs in at 94 proof. Knowing that, we can estimate that the Tully Tea is about 18 percent alcohol by volume (36 proof).\n\nDoes that surprise you? It should, because the Long Island family of drinks has a reputation of being very potent when, in reality, they are not. Any of these ""tea"" drinks look strong because of the longer list of liquors. However, the four spirits add up to only a 2-ounce pour and it is almost half as strong as most classic martinis.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-tully-tea-cocktail-recipe-4156980

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nTo get a real taste of the Massey cocktail, follow Grier\'s original spirits of choice: Tullamore Dew Irish Whiskey, Bombay Sapphire Gin, and Carpano Antica Formula for the sweet vermouth. Other brands can be substituted for these, though not every combination is going to be ideal.\nSwitching out the Green Chartreuse is more difficult because the liqueur uses a specific (and secret) blend of herbs and botanicals. The next best option is Dolin G?n?py from Haus Alpenz.\nHow Strong Is the Massey Cocktail?\nSince it is made up of five distilled spirits and no nonalcoholic mixers, it is reasonable to assume that the Massey is not a weak drink. When following Grier\'s brand suggestions, this cocktail is a heavyweight at 32 percent ABV (64 proof). This is not unusual for martini-style drinks, though its impact should not be underestimated.\nWhat\'s a Good Substitute for Campari?\nCampari is a proprietary ap?ritif. While there is no exact match for its bittersweet, herbal-citrus taste, there are two excellent options:\nTempus Fugit Gran Classico is a Swiss-made bitter based on a 19th-century Italian recipe called ""Bitter of Turin."" It\'s made with natural ingredients and has a very similar taste.\nLeopold Bros. Aperitivo was developed as a Campari substitute. It uses natural ingredients, including cochineal, to achieve the red color. Originally, this insect-derived dye was in Campari, but it was substituted with artificial colorings in 2006 to make the ap?ritif vegan.\nThe 10 Best Irish Whiskeys in 2023']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/massey-cocktail-recipe-4156983

Rather than mixing a pasty sauce into the drink, just the essence of the sauce is used to add that signature flavor.\nThe BBQ water can be made in any quantity you desire. If you are just curious about the drink, it may be best to make just enough for one or two drinks. No matter how much you make, be sure to keep the sauce-to-water ratio equal.\nIn a mixing bowl, combine barbecue sauce with an equal part of steaming hot water.\nWhisk until fully incorporated.\nLet sit to cool, or refrigerate.\nMake the Cocktail\nOne of the most surprising parts of this cocktail is how the beer is treated.

An easy way to do this is to cut each fruit into four or five thick slices. Stack the slices and make two cuts lengthwise, then a single cut in the opposite direction.\nPlace the pear pieces into a jar and pour enough brandy over them so they are fully submerged.\nCover the jar and allow it to sit in a cool place for 12 to 24 hours. There\'s no need to refrigerate it. When your drunken pears are ready, it\'s time to build the cocktail. For this, you will use the same brandy the pears were soaked in, which should be gently infused with a little fruit flavor.\nMake the Pear Cobbler\nGather the ingredients.\nCombine the pear brandy, sherry, and cinnamon syrup in a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Shake well.\nIn a chilled glass, begin building the cobbler by intermingling crushed ice or small ice cubes with drunken pears and a few grapes until the glass is full.\nStrain the contents of the shaker into the prepared glass.\nTop with a few more drunken pear pieces and grapes if desired.\nServe and enjoy!\nTip\nHave a cocktail skewer or toothpick nearby so you can pick out and eat the pears and grapes. Though it\'s not a garnish, this is one time when you\'re actually encouraged to eat the drink\'s fruit. It\'s part of the fun, so ignore ""proper"" etiquette and enjoy your drunken pears.\nHow Strong Is a Pear Cobbler?\nThe pear cobbler is not a gentle cocktail. In fact, it mixes up to the same strength as the average fruity martini. That should fall somewhere in the 22 percent ABV (44 proof) range and doesn\'t account for the alcohol in the pears.\nChoosing a Pear Brandy\nA trip to the liquor store should come up with at least one pear-flavored liquor option. Pear brandies tend to come in two styles. One is a true pear brandy that is distilled from pears rather than grapes. The other is more like a liqueur that has been sweetened. The latter is rather common in many fruit brandies (apple, cherry, etc.) and tends to be a less expensive option. You can also look for a pear-flavored eau de vie.\nWith the recent cocktail renaissance, many distillers are choosing to forgo the sweeteners that have been added to fruit brandies for decades. This means that true pear brandy which is no sweeter than the average brandy or cognac is becoming more readily available. This is great news for cocktails, though you can expect to pay more for these offerings. \nQuite often, to find a great pear brandy, you need to look to craft distillers. St. George Spirits and Clear Creek are two brands that produce very impressive pear brandies and they\'re available throughout the U.S. Also, look to the offerings of your local distillery because many of the smallest producers are making fantastic pear brandies.\nDIY Pear Brandy\nAnother option, which will take more time, is to make your own pear-infused brandy. Simply choose your favorite bottle of standard brandy, slice up a few pears, and combine them in an infusion jar. To get the maximum flavor, the infusion should take about one week. Strain out the pears, and you have a tasty pear brandy without the sweetener.\nTry a Pear Liqueur\nPear liqueurs are certainly another option, but they are sweet (as all liqueurs are). If you choose to go this route, be sure to choose a fino sherry rather than an oloroso. Finos are drier and less rich, which will retain the balance with the sweeter liqueur. Today, you can find some fantastic pear liqueurs; top recommendations include Berentzen, Bols, and Mathilde.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pear-cobbler-cocktail-recipe-4149595

Be sure to include a few berries as well. Enjoy.\nA Tip on Those Lemons\nIf you're using fresh-squeezed lemon juice?which is recommended?you will need about four lemons for this punch. Depending on the size, each lemon should yield around 1 3/4 ounces of juice.\nBefore juicing, you can also cut lemon spirals from the peel and store them in ice-cold water in the refrigerator until it's time for the party. Add these when garnishing each drink.\nMake It a Single Cocktail\nWhile this is a great drink to enjoy at a party, you can also enjoy it as a single-serve cocktail. It is just as easy and goes back to Brockmans' original berry fresh recipe.\nTo make the drink, combine 2 ounces Brockmans gin, 1 ounce each triple sec and cranberry juice, 3/4 ounce lemon juice, and a bar spoon of allspice dram in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake well. Strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with alternating layers of crushed ice and seasonal berries.\nRecipe from Brockmans Gin.\nHow Strong Is the Cranberry Fresh Punch?\nThe punch recipe has been adapted from the original cocktail to make it more suitable for a party situation. The gin was cut back and cranberry took its place to ensure it doesn't take your guests by surprise.\n\nWhy is that necessary? Brockmans' berry fresh recipe has an estimated alcohol content of 23 percent ABV (46 proof). By adjusting the punch, we've knocked that down to 18 percent ABV (36 proof). While the stronger drink is nice to enjoy on its own, it can be too much for unsuspecting party guests who may have more than one cup. The great news is that all the flavors are still there and it retains a nice balance.\n\nTry to keep alcohol content in mind whenever you convert a cocktail into a punch and make adjustments as you see fit.

Shake it once a day and give it a taste test on the second day to see how the flavor\'s developing. Do this daily until it reaches your desired taste.\nOnce you like the flavor, strain out the spices and fruit using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth, squeezing or pressing out any excess liqueur.\nBottle the spiced pear liqueur under a tight seal and add a label with the date and flavor.\nServe in your favorite cocktails and enjoy!\nTips\nThe standard bottle of liquor (called a fifth) is 750 milliliters, which is about 25 ounces. Since you need to leave room in the jar for your flavoring ingredients and syrup, you will only need about 20 ounces. Go ahead and enjoy the leftover brandy while preparing your liqueur.\nAs with any homemade liqueur, it has a shorter shelf life than other liquor infusions because of the sweetener. Store the finished liqueur in the refrigerator, where it will keep well for up to 3 months.\nChoose Your Liquor\nPear brandy lays a nice foundation for the liqueur, though you\'ll want to choose wisely because some on the market already have a sweetener (technically making them liqueurs). Non-sweetened pear brandies (eau de vie) are available from brands like St. George Spirits and Clear Creek Distillery, just read the label carefully. If the sweetened version is your only option, cut back on the syrup in the recipe.\nThis recipe can also be used with a standard grape-based brandy and it\'s a lot of fun with vodka or white rum.\nRecipe Variations\nThe fun part about making your own liqueurs is that you can experiment and create a custom flavor. Feel free adjust any of the ingredients to develop your own ""secret"" recipe. It\'s difficult to go wrong, especially if you do the daily taste test.\nUse a variety of pears. Pear season begins in autumn and runs through winter, bringing with it a number of pear varieties to the market. There\'s no reason to add just one type to your liqueur. For instance, adding half of both an Anjou and Bartlett pear is a really nice combination. The pears don\'t need to be sliced any certain way and you don\'t have to peel them as long as they\'re washed. If you can fit the pear into your jar, you\'re good.\nPlay with your syrup. While plain simple syrup makes a nice liqueur, there are alternatives. Since this is designed to have a warmer profile, consider switching from white sugar to a darker one. You can use turbinado or demerara sugars in the standard syrup recipe or mix up something like a brown sugar spiced syrup. Either option will add a nice and warm richness to the liqueur.\nAdjust the spices as you see fit. Cinnamon, star anise, and cloves are almost essential to getting a great spice blend, so you can skip the allspice if you like. If you have only ground spices available of any of them, add them to the syrup when you make it and use a little more than you normally would.\nEnjoy Your Liqueur\nThe spiced pear liqueur can be used in a variety of cocktails. It can put a sweet seasonal spin on many brandy drinks or those that call for a pear vodka. Recipes that use pear liqueurs are obvious choices as well, even if it doesn\'t call for one that\'s spiced.\nTo get you started, try it instead of pear brandy in the pear cobbler recipe. It can also take the place of the nectar and spices in the spiced pear caipirini or the infused vodka in the autumn spiced tonic. \nHow Strong Is the Spiced Pear Liqueur?\nA straight (unsweetened) pear brandy is typically bottled at 80 proof, just like grape-based brandy. The simple syrup in this recipe will bring the alcohol content down slightly. The finished liqueur should weigh in around 33 percent ABV (66 proof), which is standard for most fruit-flavored liqueurs.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-spiced-pear-liqueur-recipe-4155871

Serve and enjoy.\nHoney Vodka\nThis recipe was created by 42 Below Vodka to show off their honey-flavored vodka. The New Zealand distiller was among the first to debut the flavor and it remains one of the best brands for it. The balance they found between the alcohol and the sweet manuka honey is definitely hard to beat. Above all your other options, try this cocktail with this vodka.\nIf you cannot find 42 Below, you do have options. Among the best are the honey vodkas from small distilleries and a couple in the U.S. are producing fine examples. These include Barr Hill Vodka from Caledonia Spirits in Vermont and Spring 44 out of Colorado.\nYou know 42 Below hit a great flavor with honey because in recent years a number of the big names in vodka released a bottle in this flavor. Brands like Absolut, Smirnoff, and Stolichnaya now offer a honey vodka. These may not be our top recommendations, though you could certainly try them.\nIn past experience, the bigger distillers tend to over-sweeten their flavored vodkas. In contrast, craft distillers tend to take the time to get them absolutely perfect. If you do pick up a sweeter honey vodka, you might need to back off a bit on the syrup used in the cocktail.\nHow Strong Is the Manuka Maple Sour?\nTypically, a cocktail that has only one liquor is a relatively mild drink and this recipe follows suit. 42 Below Honey is bottled at 80 proof rather than 70 proof, which is standard for flavored vodkas. This small difference makes the drink a little more powerful.\n\nIf you follow the recipe, you can expect your manuka maple sour to weigh in right around 16 percent ABV (32 proof).

Check it again and repeat this step until you have the flavor you want.\nWhen the infusion is to your liking, strain the coffee beans through a fine strainer from the whiskey.\nReturn the whiskey to its original bottle, cap it and enjoy it any cocktail you see fit.\nTips\nWe prefer to use coffee beans that are darker such as Spanish and French roasts. These tend to be richer than the lighter roasts and pair better with whiskey.\nTo test a whiskey/bean combination without wasting a lot of whiskey, try a smaller batch first. Pour a couple of shots of whiskey in a smaller jar and add a handful of coffee beans. Allow this to infuse and see what you like. Do this with multiple whiskey and bean combinations at once, clearly labeling each, then taste each in succession and decide which you like best. After that, you're ready to infuse a large batch of your favorite.\nWhen choosing a whiskey for this infusion, it's best to try ones that are smooth and not too spicy.\nThough you may be inclined to do so, we do not recommend mixing this coffee infusion into drinks that already contain coffee. It may work, but defeats the purpose of flavoring your whiskey with coffee because coffee is already there. Instead, think of complementary flavors such as almond, banana, chestnut, kumquat and orange.\nYou can use the coffee beans once they've infused into the alcohol.

Garnish with a peach slice or lime twist, or both. Serve and enjoy!\nTips\nFor the blended cocktail, if you find that the mix is too thick, add an extra splash of juice or schnapps. If it's too thin, add a couple of extra ice cubes. Blend again until it's your desired consistency.\nYou can serve a margarita in any glass you like: margarita, cocktail, and rocks glasses are the most popular. The shaken drinks can be served up or strained over fresh ice.\nTry the peach margarita in a sugar-rimmed glass. A blend of brown sugar and white sugar is a great option for peach drinks.\nIf you use canned peaches, you may want to adjust the amount of sugar or peach schnapps, since peaches in syrup are considerably sweeter than fresh or frozen peaches.\nTo prevent peach garnishes from turning brown, dunk slices into a little lemon juice. It's the same trick used for apple garnishes and other oxygen-sensitive fruits.\nRecipe Variations\nFor an extra peach flavor, use 1/2 ounce of peach schnapps instead of sugar.\nSkip the blender and shake up a peach margarita: Muddle the peach slices and sugar in a cocktail shaker, add the tequila, triple sec, and lime juice, and fill the shaker with ice. Shake well and strain into a chilled glass.\nFor a margarita that uses peach schnapps alone, shake 1 1/2 ounces tequila, 1 ounce peach schnapps, and 1/2 ounce each of triple sec and lime juice with ice. Strain into a chilled glass.\nHow Strong Is the Peach Margarita?\nThe alcohol content of a peach margarita will depend on the liquors you choose. While tequila's often 80-proof, the schnapps and triple sec will vary. Generally, a frozen peach margarita falls in the 12 percent ABV (24 proof) range, and the shaken drink will be a little stronger. The version made with peach schnapps alone will be about twice the strength when made with a 48-proof schnapps.\nWhat Kind of Tequila Is Best for Margaritas?\nTequila is one of the key ingredients in a margarita and a cheap, low-quality tequila will make a low-quality drink. Pick up a medium to high-end blanco or reposado tequila for margaritas. A blanco is best for flavored margaritas since it won't compete too much with the fruit and other additions.\n20 Peachy Cocktails You Have to Try""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/peach-margarita-frozen-759766

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a cocktail glass.\nAdd dashes of bitters on top. Serve and enjoy.\nThe ginger liqueur and pimento dram are very small pours, but that's the original recipe. If you find that it's not quite enough, try pouring 1/2 ounce (1 tablespoon) of either or both liqueurs and see how you like the taste.\nMake It a Hot Toddy\nThe aromatics in the winter cocktail make it an ideal candidate to create a variation on the popular hot toddy. It's very simple to do and the heat can really amplify all the spices.\nTo make this a hot toddy, combine the ingredients in an Irish coffee glass or your favorite mug. Top it off with hot water or freshly brewed tea, stir, and enjoy.\nIf you'd like to go with tea, consider black and green teas. Earl Grey or an oolong would be excellent choices. It would also be very interesting if you were to use a rooibos. It has a wonderful smoky flavor that plays really well with ginger and other spices.\nChoose Your Rum\nYou have many choices when it comes to the rum you pour into the winter cocktail. Generally, you'll find it best with either a light or aged rum. The light rum will add to the sweetness, while an aged rum will impart a slight oakiness to the drink's flavor profile. \nIt would be best to skip spiced rums because it will likely conflict with the drink's spices.\nSugar or Syrup?\nYou will find that many classic cocktail recipes use sugar rather than simple syrup, which many of us prefer to use today. The syrup is simply sugar in a liquid form, so it dissolves better in drinks. If you prefer, substitute simple syrup for the sugar.\nIn general, it's recommended to use 1/4 ounce of simple syrup for 1 teaspoon of sugar. Depending on how sweet you made your syrup, you may need to adjust this to taste.\nHow Strong Is the Winter Cocktail?\nAs with many short drinks that are made mostly of alcoholic ingredients, the original winter cocktail is not what we'd consider a weak drink. As written, it tends to be around 25 percent alcohol by volume (50 proof) when mixed up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/winter-cocktail-recipe-760510

Or you can slowly drizzle the vodka onto the cranberry juice for a swirling effect. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf Blavod is not your vodka of choice or you can\'t find it, you can always make your own black vodka using whichever brand you prefer. The trick is as simple as using a certain combination of food coloring.\nNo matter what vodka you use, it may not create a perfect layer on top of the cranberry. the black will immediately take over some of the red juice and the two will slowly become one as the drink settles.\nRecipe Variations\nPour this drink as a layered shot if you like. Simply fill a shot glass almost half way with cranberry juice then top it with the black vodka.\nTopping this drink off with a light soda (e.g., lemon-lime or ginger ale) can create a momentary bubbling cauldron effect.\nHave fun creating creepy garnishes for this drink. Adding a lychee eyeball on top of the glass could really freak out your guests if you don\'t cover it completely with the vodka. Another easy option is to get Halloween-themed iced cube trays.\nYou can use this recipe with other fruit juices as the base. For instance, Blavod floats perfectly on top of orange juice, creating drink called the October screwdriver. That would be a fun drink to top with a ""pumpkin"" orange garnish, though you\'ll have to drink it with a straw.\nHow Strong Is a Black Widow?\nWhen a little dilution is factored in for the ice, the black widow is not a very potent cocktail. In fact, its alcohol content is just 14 percent ABV (28 proof), which is typical of highball mixed drinks. It\'s similar to drinking a glass of wine, but wine can\'t touch the visual appeal of this drink.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-widow-recipe-761008

When you want it to be thicker, add a couple of extra ice cubes.\nHow Strong Is a Wedding Cake Cocktail?\nThe blended wedding cake is a delightfully low-proof cocktail. On average, its alcohol content is just 8 percent ABV (16 proof), falling right between the strength of beer and wine.\nRecipe Variations\nThe other popular wedding cake cocktail has a hint of chocolate. For this recipe, you'll shake 1 1/2 ounces of amaretto, 1/2 ounce of white cr?me de cacao, and 2 ounces each of milk and pineapple juice with ice. Instead of straining, pour the entire contents of the shaker into a highball or hurricane glass.\nThere are also a number of recipes for a wedding cake martini. These typically feature vanilla vodka and pineapple, straining the drinks into a cocktail glass. One version shakes 2 ounces of vanilla vodka, 1 ounce each of pineapple and cranberry juices, and a splash of simple syrup.\nAnother martini is simpler and brings back the chocolate. To make it, shake 1 ounce each of vanilla vodka, white cr?me de cacao, and pineapple juice.\nCoconut rum is also a fun addition to any wedding cake cocktail.

Drizzle the remaining cassis into the drink over the twists of a bar spoon to get a purple haze that slowly dissolves.\n\nAnother option is to build the drink, first adding the tequila into a collins glass with ice, then the lime juice, ginger beer, and finally adding a float of cassis on top.\nDevilish Variation\nA modern take on El Diablo brings a little ginger into the mix. It's a fabulous rendition and just one more example of how versatile this cocktail is. To make this snappy and refreshing cocktail:\nShake 2 ounces Gran Centenario Plata Tequila with 3/4 ounce of fresh lemon juice, 3/4 ounce of Domaine de Canton ginger liqueur, and 1/4 ounce cr?me de cassis liqueur.\nStrain it into a chilled coupe glass and garnish it with a thinly sliced lemon wheel.\nHow Strong Is an El Diablo Cocktail?\nThe amount of ginger beer you pour will greatly affect the alcohol content of El Diablo. If you pour 4 ounces of soda over an 80-proof tequila and 20-proof cassis, the drink comes in at a refreshingly mild 14 percent ABV (28 proof).

Typically, they are made with fruit, sugar, honey, molasses, herbs, and spices macerated in vodka or rectified spirits known as spirytus rektyfikowany. Other flavors, like coffee, flower, honey, and specific spice nalewki like kardamonka (cardamom), also exist.\nNalewki names come from the type of the main ingredient used to produce them or the town where they originated. A popular nalewka named after a town is Nalewka Tarnin?wka, originating from the town of Tarn?w near Krak?w in Ma©©opolska (Lesser Poland). It\'s made with sloe berries and is ruby red in color.\nMany recipes are closely guarded secrets, passed down from generation to generation. The type of spirit used renders them either benign concoctions of about 40 to 45% alcohol or knock-your-socks-off varieties as strong as 75% alcohol.\nNalewka-Drinking Etiquette\nNalewki is always drunk from little glasses and often served after a meal, at celebratory occasions like weddings and baptisms. It would be an insult to your host if you bolted down a glass like a shot of vodka. A nalewka should be sipped so that its virtues can be appreciated. It should be allowed to linger on the tongue and then swirled around the mouth much as one would do with fine wine.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/polish-blueberry-cordial-likier-borowkowy-recipe-1135659

After cutting the necessary peels, cut the lemons in half and juice them to reduce waste; half of a lemon should yield the 1 ounce needed for the recipe.\nClove-studded orange slices are a great decoration for many winter drinks and add a little extra flavor. Simply poke the pointy end of four or five cloves into the flesh of each orange slice.\nHow Strong Is a Hot Gin Punch?\nThis steaming punch should come with a warning label! It's delicious and comforting, but it's also twice the strength of the average party punch. The hot gin punch's alcohol content should fall somewhere in the 21 percent ABV (42 proof) range, making it about the same as drinking a cosmopolitan. It's a good idea to stick with small 4-ounce servings so it doesn't sneak up on your guests.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hot-gin-punch-recipes-760029

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe sea breeze is one of the few drinks in which the quality of your vodka is not going to make a significant difference. The fruit juices will mask slight impurities, so feel free to use your ""well"" vodka here.\nLook for a quality budget-friendly vodka that you would not mind drinking straight. There are a number of tasty and inexpensive vodkas to choose from today.\nUnless you have a juicer and it is cranberry season, making fresh cranberry juice is not as easy as making other fruit juices. However, with grapefruit, a manual juicer will give you fresh juice to make a great sea breeze.\nRecipe Variations\nThough the 3:1 mix of cranberry to grapefruit juices is customary for the sea breeze, feel free to adjust the ratio to suit your taste.\nTransform this into a punch by maintaining the proportions and scaling up each ingredient. For example, to fill a 60-ounce pitcher, combine 11 ounces (1 1/3 cups) vodka, 30 ounces (3 3/4 cups) cranberry juice, and 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) grapefruit juice. Stir and adjust to taste. Add a little ice to the pitcher or pour it over ice in the glass.\nThe sea breeze can also be shaken and strained over fresh ice. This adds a little more air to the drink, which is very appealing, especially on really hot days.\nAdd extra zing by choosing a flavored vodka. Almost any of the fruit vodkas?particularly strawberry and citrus?are a fantastic base.\nGive the juice drink a little sparkle. Club soda, tonic water, and ginger ale are excellent choices that will lighten up the drink.\nVodka and Fruit Juice Variations\nThe vodka and fruit juice family of drinks includes many drinks that are very similar. All are made in the same way, but the variations can be confusing. Here\'s the breakdown:\nSea breeze is cranberry with grapefruit juice.\nGreyhound adds grapefruit juice.\nCape Codder mixes with cranberry juice.\nMadras is made with cranberry and orange juice.\nBay breeze is equal parts pineapple and cranberry juices.\nHow Strong Is the Sea Breeze?\nYou can make this drink as strong or soft as you like. It\'s all about how much juice you choose to pour. If you follow the recipe with 80-proof vodka, it\'s a relatively tame 10 percent alcohol by volume (20 proof). This is average for a fruit or soda highball and about the same as a glass of wine.\nDrinks & Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sea-breeze-cocktail-recipe-760599

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Jolly Rancher can be served however you like and modified to fit any occasion, from casual to fancy.\nTo make the highball version a little more refreshing, top the Jolly Rancher with ginger ale or another clear soda.\nTransform your Jolly Rancher into a high-class martini by shaking the ingredients and serving it ""up"" in a cocktail glass.\nThis recipe is an ideal candidate for a party punch. Keep the ingredients in proportion and scale the recipe up. A little ginger ale or club soda will add a nice sparkle as well.\nCreate a Jolly Rancher shot that goes down smoother than most. Pour 1 ounce of each ingredient, shake the drink with ice, then strain it into two or three separate shot glasses.\nThe Jolly Rancher is the perfect candidate for a fun jello shot, too. Just pick up a package of cranberry gelatin and skip the juice.\nChoose an Apple Vodka\nYou will find no shortage of apple vodka options. A homemade apple vodka infusion is one of easiest and a great project for beginners. There are also plenty of apple-flavored vodkas available on the market.\nIf you prefer to buy your vodka, any liquor store should have at least a couple of options. They range from inexpensive to top-shelf and can be crystal clear or bright green. A green-colored vodka will alter the look of the drink, but that\'s perfectly fine because the Jolly Rancher is all about the taste.\nAmong the apple vodkas available, four stand out from the crowd:\nUV Green: This is the greenest of all green apple vodkas you will find. A bottle doesn\'t cost much at all and the color is a fun addition to any bar. If you like UV Blue, you\'ll love this one.\nSmirnoff Green Apple: Many liquor stores stock a nice selection of Smirnoff\'s flavored vodkas and it\'s one of the best budget-friendly brands. Their green apple vodka is as clear as any unflavored vodka and it tastes pretty good for the price.\nEffen Green Apple: If you\'re looking for a top-shelf vodka, Effen Green Apple is one of the best options. It has a super clean taste and the green apple flavor is true to the source. \nVan Gogh Wild Appel: It may not be flavored with green apples, but it does have a great apple flavor. Van Gogh\'s apple is another premium option and it\'s typically pretty easy to find.\nHow Strong Is the Jolly Rancher?\nThe Jolly Rancher is a very mild cocktail, which makes it perfect for happy hour or anytime you want a casual mixed drink. Most flavored vodkas are bottled at 35 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 70 proof), so they\'re a little lighter than standard vodka. When you mix that with the popular Peachtree (24 percent ABV), the drink weighs in around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).\nDo Jolly Rancher Candies Dissolve in Vodka?\nHard candies like Jolly Ranchers make a fun vodka infusion that\'s brightly colored and has a sweet, fruity taste. It\'s incredibly easy because the candy dissolves in the liquor, and the process is faster than most infused vodkas. You can try this with white rum or blanco tequila, too.\nUse about 10 to 15 candies for every cup of vodka. Divide them by color and make multiple infusions of different flavors at one time.\nDrop unwrapped candies into a jar and fill with vodka. Seal and let sit for about 12 to 24 hours, or until the candy is completely dissolved. To speed it up, shake the jar every couple of hours. Unlike other candy infusions (such as Skittles), there\'s no need to filter it.\nUse the candy-flavored vodka in the Jolly Rancher cocktail, pour a shot, top it with soda, or enjoy it however you like.\nThe candy\'s sugar naturally adds a little sweetness to the vodka. Some people like to build on that and make it more like a liqueur than a vodka. The easiest way to do that is to mix simple syrup into the finished infusion. Start small, with just 1/2 ounce of syrup for 1 cup of vodka, shake the jar, taste, and add more syrup to suit your taste.\nGummy Bear Martini']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jolly-rancher-vodka-cocktail-761086

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nChoose your favorite version of hot chocolate for this recipe. It can be a homemade powdered cocoa mix, a fancy drinking chocolate recipe, or store-bought cocoa. You want one that\'s rich and flavorful and steaming hot.\nTo keep the drink warmer longer, preheat your mug. Do so by pouring hot water into it while you prepare your cocoa and dump it before building the drink. Also, do not use chilled liqueurs as they will instantly cool down your drink.\nCr?me de menthe comes in two colors (white and green), as does cr?me de cacao (white and dark). While that plays a role in other drinks, it doesn\'t really matter which you pour because the hot chocolate dominates this drink. You may notice slight variations in the drink\'s color, but the taste will be the same.\nArcher\'s Peppermint Patty\nThe hot peppermint patty made it onto the small screen in a January 2015 episode of the hit cartoon ""Archer"" (""The Archer Station""?Season 6, Episode 3). As is seen on so many occasions (remember the flaming Moe/Homer from ""The Simpsons""?), fans just had to get the drink after it aired.\nIn the episode, Archer pours from a thermos and declares, ""I call it a Peppermint Patty."" He proceeds to say exactly what\'s in his ""Wow"" drink and it\'s the exact recipe you see above.\nJust to be clear, this is the drink that Archer freaked out over and it is worthy of the cartoon\'s exclamation. However, Archer (nor the show\'s writers) did not create this drink, so it\'s technically not ""Archer\'s peppermint patty"" as some on the internet will have you believe.\nIn fact, this is an old recipe?it was first published here in 2006, and the recipe\'s been around a lot longer than that. It\'s very likely that the show\'s creators have the same fascination with the hot peppermint patty that many of us do. The show just gave it a well-deserved spotlight.\nSo, yes, this is the peppermint patty that Archer so enthusiastically enjoyed, but it is nothing new. Now go mix one up and have your own ""Oh my God"" moment!\nRecipe Variations\nOver the years, many drink recipes have taken the peppermint patty name. If you\'d like a cold mint-chocolate drink, try one of the peppermint patty cocktail recipes. One of the tastiest versions uses chocolate vodka, peppermint schnapps, and RumChata cream liqueur.\nThere is also the peppermint patty shooter. It is one of the tastiest party shots you can make. Again, there are a few ways to approach it, including one that has you mix chocolate syrup and schnapps right in your mouth!\nIf you have a coffee liqueur such as Kahlua in your bar, try a chocolate kiss instead. It\'s an equally tempting hot chocolate recipe, but the coffee flavor is an interesting twist to the schnapps and cocoa.\nHow Strong Is a Hot Peppermint Patty?\nYou can intensify both the mint flavor and the drink\'s strength by your choice in peppermint schnapps. While the other two liqueurs average 25 percent ABV (50 proof), peppermint schnapps can range from 15 percent to 50 percent ABV (30 to 100 proof).\n\nWhen it comes to estimating the drink\'s alcohol content, you can expect the hot peppermint patty made with 30-proof schnapps to weigh in around 5 percent ABV (10 proof). If you choose a 100-proof schnapps, it will be about 11 percent ABV (22 proof). In the grand scheme of cocktails, even the high-proof schnapps mix is mild.\n\nHowever, it\'s important to remember that how drunk you get is not the only factor. You\'ll want to consider the flavor as well. The general rule is that the higher the proof of liquor, the stronger the flavor will be.\n\nIf you want a bang of peppermint, try a high-proof brand like Rumple Minze. For a drink that\'s a bit more balanced, choose a lower-proof schnapps. Keep in mind that the recipe already doubles up on the mint, so it can become too minty for some tastes.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hot-peppermint-patty-recipe-759691

It\'s recommended because it dissolves easier in cold drinks. There\'s no need to hunt it down at the store; you can simply run the sugar you already have through a food processor or blender. It should take just a couple of minutes at high speed.\nRather than sugar, pour about 1/2 ounce of simple syrup. It\'s convenient because the sugar\'s already dissolved and it\'s very easy and inexpensive to make.\nImprove the taste of this fizz by using fresh-squeezed lemon juice. The average lemon yield 1 3/4 ounces of juice, so one fruit is plenty for a single drink.\nRecipe Variations\nOne common substitution often attributed to the ""imperial"" (rather than the whiskey) fizz is to pour sparkling wine (typically Champagne) rather than soda.\nIn fizz tradition, add an egg white to this recipe to give the drink a foamy top and luxurious mouthfeel. Be sure to shake it extra hard and longer than normal to integrate the egg into the drink.\nAdd an underlying flavor if you like. Orange liqueurs are popular additions (pour about 1 ounce). Absinthe, berry liqueurs, or even favorite whiskey pairing liqueurs can be added as well.\nYou can also make a flavored simple syrup. Cinnamon syrup is great for winter and berry syrups are fun in summer.\nBring in a fresh, cooling taste by muddling a few mint leaves in the shaker with the lemon juice and sugar before adding the whiskey.\nHow Strong Is an Imperial Fizz?\nLike most highball mixed drinks, the imperial fizz is a pretty light drink. When made with the average 80-proof whiskey, its alcohol content is just 10 percent ABV (20 proof), equivalent to a glass of wine.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/imperial-or-whiskey-fizz-recipe-759697

It\'s very sweet, so when paired with B?renj?ger, it may be too sweet for some tastes.\nThere are other lemon liqueurs, such as Lombardi Limonata, which is described as ""lemonade with a kick."" Another fun option is Spirits of the Blue Ridge Lemon Liqueur, a product of Chesapeake Bay Distillery in Virginia; other craft distilleries may also offer the lemon flavor.\nTo make this shooter a little smoother, chill your shot glasses. They\'re so small that they don\'t take up much room in the freezer and it\'s always nice to have a frosty shot ready when you are.\nDon\'t be tempted to skip the shake and just build the ingredients in a shot glass. This one really needs that extra dilution from the ice or it will be far too sweet.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to cut back on the sweetness, pour a lemon-flavored vodka instead. The fruit is most commonly found in citrus vodkas (that\'s a good choice), but you can find lemon-only vodkas from brands like Crop, Deep Eddy, New Amsterdam, and a few others.\nPour Midori or another melon liqueur rather than lemon.\nRaspberry liqueurs (e.g., Chambord) would be nice with B?renj?ger as well.\nHow Strong Is a Honey Citrus Drop Shot?\nYou might expect that a two-liqueur shot would be weaker than those with liquors like tequila or whiskey, but this one\'s a surprise. B?renj?ger is actually a 70-proof liqueur and if you go with limoncello, that\'s typically 60 proof, so it shakes up to 20 percent ABV (40 proof). To put that into perspective, taking two of these shots is equal to one straight shot of tequila.

That extra sweetness can bring the drink into balance, though it\'s good to try both options to see which you prefer.\nSome people enjoy the Idonis with 1 ounce of apricot brandy as well.\nA chilled cocktail glass helps bring the drink\'s flavors together. If you don\'t have room in the freezer to keep a few frosty (they are awkward and take up space), give it a quick chill instead.

However, it\'s a strong drink, weighing in at 24 percent ABV (48 proof), which is similar to other fruity vodka martinis.\nRecipe Variation\nVery similar to the Idonis, the Katinka is another fruity cocktail that mixes vodka with apricot brandy. It is an interesting mix of flavors that create a smooth sipper and the mint garnish adds eye appeal along with a hint of extra flavor that makes it a little more interesting.\nTo make it, pour 1 1/2 ounces of vodka, 1/2 ounce of apricot brandy, and 1/2 ounce lime juice into a mixing glass filled with ice.

It\'s most popularly used in sweet martinis like the grasshopper and hot cocoa drinks like the peppermint patty. The sweet mint liqueur mixes best with vodka and Irish whiskey, though it\'s also fascinating with brandy.\nDoes Cr?me de Menthe Go Bad?\nCr?me liqueurs contain more sugar than other liqueurs, and this slightly reduces their shelf life. However, like many distilled spirits, an open bottle of cr?me de menthe will be good for years. If you\'ve had a bottle for some time, check for an off odor, discoloration, or crystallized sugar.

To make it, combine 1/2 ounce each Southern Comfort, blue cura?ao, and raspberry liqueur in a shaker with ice. Add a splash each of sour mix, cranberry juice, and pineapple juice and shake well before straining into a shot glass.\nKiller Kool Aid: This popular version is most often served as a slow-sipping fruit highball. The recipe combines 1 1/2 ounces vodka, 1/2 ounce each of peach schnapps and amaretto in a highball glass filled with ice. Top it with cranberry juice and serve the drink unstirred. If you like, shake it and strain the drink into multiple shot glasses.\nHow Strong Are These Kool Aid Shooters?\nNo matter which variation you mix up, the alcohol content in each of these kool aid recipes is about the same. The killer kool aid is the lightest at 13 percent ABV (26 proof), and the rest average out to around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). They fall into that comfortable range that most shots do: not too strong but definitely not a pint of beer. ""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/kool-aid-shooter-recipes-759718

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a maraschino cherry. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSince it has a liqueur base, don't add too much syrup or the Grinch will be too sweet. The lemon juice counteracts that and should give the drink a nice balance of sweet and sour. Add a little more lemon if you're using a rich simple syrup or store-bought brand.\nFresh lemon juice is highly recommended because bottled versions are often sweetened, which is the last thing you want in this drink. A large lemon can yield 1 3/4 ounce of juice and that's enough for three cocktails.\nMidori may be the most popular, but it's not the only green melon liqueur available. Explore other brands that you come across to see if you have a preference; the Grinch is an excellent cocktail for comparing them.\nRecipe Variations\nAdding vodka is a popular way to give the Grinch a little kick while retaining the flavor. Keep the recipe's syrup and lemon juice, and pour 1 1/2 ounces Midori and 1 ounce of vodka. Bring in a little extra flavor with a flavored vodka; cucumber is a perfect pairing for melon and citrus vodkas are a nice, subtle accent as well.\nFor a rum-laced Grinch, try this tropical mixed drink: Shake 1 ounce each of Midori, coconut rum, and banana liqueur with ice. Strain into an old-fashioned glass over fresh ice, add a splash of lemon-lime soda, and garnish with a cherry or strawberry. Make it in a tall glass and add more soda if you like.\nAbsinthe will also produce a green cocktail and when paired with melon liqueur, its anise flavor creates a very interesting Grinch recipe. If you are a fan of classically styled cocktails and shy away from sweet martinis, this is the Grinch you should try: Build 1 ounce of absinthe, 1 1/2 ounces of melon liqueur, and 1/2 ounce of lime juice in a tall glass filled with ice. Top with ginger ale and garnish with a cherry.\nHow Strong Is the Grinch Cocktail?\nSweet, fruity cocktails are deceptive and not always as light as you may think. The average alcohol content for the original Grinch is 14 percent ABV (28 proof). With vodka or rum, it will fall in the 20 percent ABV (40 proof) range, or about the strength of the cosmopolitan. Because it includes soda, the absinthe Grinch is milder and can be as low as 11 percent ABV (22 proof) when made with 3 ounces of ginger ale.\n13 Festive Christmas Martinis You'll Love to Share""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/grinch-cocktai-fruity-green-drink-759682

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFull-flavored dry gins are often best in this cocktail because the flavor will punch through the fruits.\nThe fruits also do an excellent job of covering up a not-so-top-shelf gin. It's okay to use any gin you like with this one, including those that are budget-friendly.\nFresh-squeezed citrus juices are highly recommended for the freshest tasting cocktail. A lemon typically yields about 1 3/4 ounces of juice and one orange can yield up to 3 ounces. A single fruit of each could work for two cocktails if you back off the lemon a bit.\nA chilled glass will help meld the cocktail's flavors and keep your drink cool. The quickest method is to add some ice to the glass while you shake up the drink. Adding a little cold soda is even better. Just be sure to dump the glass before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nServe the gin and sin on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass if you prefer. To make this a little drier, add an ounce of tonic water.\nFeel free to adjust the ingredients to suit your personal taste. Some recipes use up to 2 ounces of gin and lower the lemon juice to 1/2 ounce, for instance.\nYou can also hold the grenadine and pour only the gin and juices into the shaker. Then, add the grenadine to the cocktail glass after straining to create a beautiful sunrise effect.\nHow Strong Is a Gin and Sin Cocktail?\nIn terms of its alcohol, this is not a very sinful cocktail. The fact that the non-alcoholic mixers outweigh the gin brings it down to a low 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That makes it similar in strength to a glass of wine and one of the lowest proof martini-style drinks you'll find.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/gin-and-sin-recipe-759671

Fill with ice cubes.\nShake vigorously, for at least 30 seconds, to froth up the egg white.\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk for foodborne illness.\nTips\nThough Plymouth Gin may have been used originally, dry gin is most often poured in this recipe today. Try it with both styles, just make sure that the gin is top-shelf in order to create the best drink.\nBefore mixing any cocktail with an egg, test it for freshness. All you need to do is place an egg in a glass of water; it's fresh if it sinks and should be discarded if it floats to the top.\nQuite often, egg cocktails receive a dry shake before adding ice. This is a good option, and it's easy: Combine the ingredients in the shaker but hold the ice, shake well, then add ice and shake again for 30 seconds.\nRecipe Variations\nIn many of the million dollar cocktail recipes, the ratio of the ingredients is slightly different. For instance, one uses 1/2 ounce each of sweet vermouth and pineapple juice. Try this and make more adjustments to suit your personal taste if needed.\nInspired by the original recipe, Dallas bartender George Kaiho created his own version. Featured in Imbibe, the recipe switches to Bols Genever and pours Cherry Heering rather than sweet vermouth. It also skips the grenadine.\nAnother version that has circulated for years give the pineapple-egg white spin to the perfect martini. To make it, shake 1 ounce gin, 1/4 ounce each of dry and sweet vermouths, 1/2 ounce pineapple juice, and a dash each of egg white and Angostura Bitters. Strain into a chilled glass.\nHow Strong Is a Million Dollar Cocktail?\nAdding an egg white not only gives a cocktail a frothy top, but it also helps knock down the alcohol content. With it, the million dollar cocktail should shake up to 19 percent ABV (38 proof) or so. That makes it one of the lighter options in the classic martini family, which can easily reach 60 proof.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/million-dollar-cocktail-759736

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you tend to back off on the vermouth in your martinis, you may not want to do that here because it relaxes the more flavorful spirit rather nicely. When you first try this recipe, pour the ingredients as recommended. You can always make adjustments while mixing up the next round.\nTo get the best tasting mastermix cocktail, make sure you are not pouring outdated vermouth. Once opened, a bottle only has a shelf life of about three months and it should always be refrigerated. If your vermouth doesn't meet those standards, it's time to pick up a new bottle.\nYou can also chill your bottle of J?germeister as well. Starting with cold ingredients will slow down the ice melt and reduce the dilution a little bit. It's not necessary because your cocktail will still have plenty of flavor, but some people prefer to go that route.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile dry vermouth is recommended, you may enjoy this cocktail with sweet vermouth instead. To get a balance of both, mix it up like a perfect martini with equal parts of both dry and sweet vermouth.\nHave fun exploring the bitters for this cocktail. It's a small touch that can play a significant role in accenting the base flavors. Rather than aromatic bitters like Angostura, try rhubarb, celery, or some other savory-flavored bitters. There are some fun options out there.\nYou can also vary the garnish. A simple lemon or orange twist spritzed over the glass then dropped inside the drink is a nice way to dress this one up.\nHow Strong Is a MasterMix?\nJust like most alcohol-only martinis, the mastermix is not a weak drink, though it's also not the strongest. In fact, it's more potent than a vodka Red Bull. Generally, you can expect this recipe to have an alcohol content around 22 percent ABV (44 proof). It's lighter than a gin or vodka martini simply because J?germeister is only 70 proof, where the other liquors are typically bottled at 80 proof.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mastermix-cocktail-recipe-759729

Serve and enjoy.\nWhat Is Honey Syrup?\nStraight honey is very thick and doesn't mix easily into cold cocktails. Honey syrup fixes the issue by diluting honey with water to make the natural sweetener more fluid. The typical ratio is 2 or 3 parts honey to 1 part water, stirred to a uniform consistency. It stores as well as simple syrup and you can make as much as you like at one time.\nTips\nAdjust the sweet and sour ingredients to your personal taste.\nWith each new gin you pour, you'll likely want to tweak it as well. For instance, a juniper-forward London dry gin is often best with a little less citrus (as in the recipe). When pouring a softer gin, you might want to boost the tartness with more lemon juice.\nConsider fresh lemon juice essential for the bee's knees. Bottled varieties are often sweetened and will throw off the drink's delicate balance of flavors.\nA lemon twist makes an excellent garnish. Gently squeeze it over the cocktail to express the oils and give it a bright pop of flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nSome modern versions of the bee's knees replace the lemon juice with sour mix, a citrus-flavored simple syrup commonly used in bars. When making the switch, try a mix of 2 ounces of gin, 1 1/2 ounces of sour mix, and 1 ounce of honey. It works really well with fruit-forward and floral gins.\nThe bee's knees cocktail is wonderful with vodka if you prefer that over gin.\nGive the sweetener a floral tone. Lavender honey syrup is a fantastic choice, or you can replace a portion of the honey syrup with an elderflower liqueur.\nHow Strong Is the Bee's Knees?\nAs with many classic cocktails, the bee's knees is not a light drink. Its alcohol content falls around 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

They\'re more of a liqueur than a true brandy (eau de vie) and will result in a sweeter cocktail.\nGrenadine is a pomegranate-flavored syrup that\'s essential for cocktails like the tequila sunrise. You can buy it at nearly any store, even many liquor stores keep it in stock. On the other hand, it\'s also easy to make grenadine at home using fresh pomegranate or juice.\nFresh lemon juice is recommended and will create a better tasting cocktail. One whole lemon should yield at least 1 3/4 ounces, so it\'s more than enough for a single drink.\nChilling your glass will help the drink stay colder. If you don\'t have one in the freezer, simply place a couple of ice cubes in the glass while you mix the cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nSome Boston cocktail recipes differ on the ingredients\' ratios. Any of the ingredients can be adjusted to suit your personal taste. For instance, one from the 1946 edition of ""Old Mr. Boston Deluxe Bartender\'s Guide"" is not much different from the one above. It uses 1/4 ounce each of grenadine and lemon juice.\nAnother recipe uses 1 1/2 ounce gin, 1 ounce apricot brandy, 1 ounce lemon juice, 1/4 ounce simple syrup, and 1/8 ounce grenadine. This will produce an even sweeter cocktail.\nTry the Boston cocktail with regular brandy. This option will eliminate the underlying apricot flavor, but it\'s a good option if grape brandy is all you have in stock.\nReplace the grenadine with a fruit liqueur if you like. For instance, a pomegranate liqueur like Pama will offer the same taste. If you use regular brandy, consider bringing back the apricot flavor with an apricot liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a Boston Cocktail?\nThough there are two nonalcoholic mixers in the Boston Cocktail, it has a strength similar to most martini-style drinks. Generally, you can expect it to weigh in around 28 percent ABV (56 proof). That\'s typical of this type of cocktail, and just over half the strength of a straight shot of whiskey or tequila.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/boston-cocktail-recipe-760012

Fill with ginger beer.\nGarnish with a lemon peel and cinnamon stick. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe apple and pear-infused gin is easy to make at home. You simply need a few apples and pears, and about 1 week for the flavor to fully develop.\nSchuman offers a few suggestions for each of the ingredients, which you might like to try so you can get the genuine taste of his creation. Beyond Bombay for the gin, he recommends Massenez Williams Poire Brandy, Lucid Absinthe, Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate Bitters, and apple cider that's local to you.\nAs with any cocktail, be sure to use fresh ice in the glass rather than pouring it from the shaker. The shaking process breaks down the ice considerably and if you use that in your drink it will quickly result in a watered-down cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nDon't have time for the infusion? Pour the gin as is. The drink will be slightly less fruity but no less interesting. You can even muddle a few apple and pear slices with the lemon juice before adding the other ingredients and shaking the drink. That alone can boost the flavor rather nicely.\nIf you really like homemade spirits, enhance a pear brandy with a DIY spiced pear liqueur. The recipe enhances the pear flavor and adds warm spices like allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and star anise to create a liqueur that would be wonderful in the early autumn cocktail.\nFeel free to skip the absinthe if you like. Though it is a nice touch, there's already a lot going on in this cocktail. You'll still be able to enjoy a bounty of autumn flavors without it.\nHow Strong Is the Early Autumn?\nThe early autumn may have three liquors in it, but once it's mixed up it's a relatively light drink.

Anything up to 1/2 ounce can work with certain gin-whisky combinations, and you will likely want to make slight adjustments as you change brands or styles.\nWhile blended scotch will be amazing in this martini, don't be afraid to pour a nice single malt scotch. The various regions of Scotland produce distinct styles of single malts, so there's a lot of flavor possibilities, even with just two ingredients. Plus, at just a dash, it won't cost much to pour from high-end bottles that you may not mix with normally.\nTake a hint from the Irish martini and rinse the glass with scotch then bring back the vermouth.\nHow Strong Is a Smoky Martini?\nAnytime you see a cocktail that's made entirely of liquor (especially full-proof liquor), you should not be surprised that it's a strong drink. The smoky martini will not disappoint! When made with two 40-proof spirits, it stirs up to a hefty 33 percent ABV (66 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nBeefeater 24 is the recommended gin for this drink. It\'s a twist on the standard bottle of gin from the brand. The primary difference is that two types of green tea (Japanese Sencha and Chinese green tea) are added to the list of botanicals.\nFor the elderflower liqueur, St. Germain is likely the easiest one to find. There are a few others on the market, including from brands like Bols, Fiorente, and Gifford.\nChambord is the best-known raspberry liqueur but, again, there are other options worth exploring. Bols, di Amore, and Rouge are just a few good choices.\nWhen pouring the raspberry liqueur, using a spoon will disrupt the flow. It\'s a technique that\'s typically used for floating drink ingredients, but here the heavier liqueur should sink to the bottom and slowly rise as you drink. Don\'t stir the cocktail in the serving glass or you will lose the effect.\nRecipe Variations\nAny sparkling wine will do just fine in the Waterloo sunset. Champagne is often used in recipes because it\'s the best-known, but you can save money and still have a fabulous drink by pouring something like Prosecco or a sparkling ros?.\nThough no garnish is suggested in the recipe, floating a few fresh raspberries on top of the drink is a lovely way to dress it up.\nIf you like, switch to the ""original"" sunrise ingredient and pour grenadine instead of a liqueur.

London dry gins will work very nicely, as will any juniper-forward gin.\nYour dry vermouth should be fresh: less than three months old and refrigerated once opened. If it's been a while since you picked up a bottle, add it to your shopping list.\nFor the apricot brandy, don't be afraid to pay a little more for a quality bottle. Many of the inexpensive options are too sweet for cocktails that are this simple. If you can find a true apricot brandy, that would be preferred. There are a few sweetened liqueur versions that are worthy as well; look for brands like Bols and Luxardo.\nThough it's just an accent, fresh lemon juice will also create a better cocktail. One lemon should yield about 1 3/4 ounce of juice, which is plenty for a few Thanksgiving cocktails.\nWhile you may not give much thought to the cherry garnish, you probably should (especially if you like to nibble on it). Those neon red maraschinos that are so popular and easy to find are anything but natural. A better bet is to seek out natural cherries without artificial colorings or dyes.\nHow Strong Is a Thanksgiving Cocktail?\nThe Thanksgiving cocktail is a pretty strong drink, but it's right in line with similar gin cocktails.

Muddle until the flavor is released.\nAdd the gin, lime juice, agave nectar, and ginger.\nShake vigorously.\nStrain into an ice-filled highball glass. Top off with ginger ale.\nGarnish with a lime wheel spiked with a lemongrass straw. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nA ""sprig"" of mint is a bit vague because it can vary in size. Typically, mint cocktails (like the mojito) do well with fewer than 10 leaves, though you can add more if you like.\nWhen using fresh lemongrass, you want to use the main yellow stalk above the bulb. Remove any outer leaves and rinse before cutting it into about 2-inch pieces.\nDried lemongrass can also be used. It would be helpful to add the agave nectar (or syrup) and lime juice to the muddle to help rehydrate it a little.\nFresh ginger is a great substitute for ground ginger, which has a more concentrated flavor. For this drink, use about 1 tablespoon of freshly ground ginger and add it to the muddled ingredients.\nRecipe Variations\nFinish this drink off with sparkling wine rather than soda. A sweet ros?, such as white zinfandel, is an excellent choice, though a Spanish seco or semi-seco cava would be fabulous as well.\nPut a lemonade twist on the cocktail by splitting the ginger ale pour with freshly squeezed lemonade. Alternatively, switch to a bottled sparkling lemonade.\nIf you prefer vodka, New Amsterdam has some really nice vodkas available, too. The brand\'s flavored vodkas would be a good fit, particularly the peach and coconut, two flavors that pair well with lemongrass.\nHow Strong Is a Soho Cocktail?\nLike most highballs, the Soho cocktail is a rather light drink. Its alcohol content should fall somewhere in the 12 percent ABV (24 proof) range, making it equivalent to a gin and tonic as well as a glass of wine.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/soho-cocktail-recipe-760123

Feel free to use any style of gin as most will work very well and the array of flavors available is fun to explore.\nBe sure your vermouth is fresh because the fortified wine doesn\'t have the long shelf life of distilled spirits. If it\'s been longer than three months since you opened a bottle and it has not been in the refrigerator, you\'ll want to replenish your supply.\nWith high-end ingredients, it\'s best to use fresh-squeezed orange juice. The average orange yields 2 to 3 ounces, so you\'ll have more than enough for a few drinks from a single piece of fruit.\nRecipe Variations\nA common variation on this recipe is to pour 1 ounce of gin, then just 1/2 ounce each of all the other ingredients.\nGrand Marnier is the brandy-based orange liqueur of choice for this recipe. If you were to replace it with orange liqueur like cura?ao, the drink would then be called a ""curled satan\'s whiskers."" It\'s a small technicality, and the two liqueurs will produce slightly different tastes. The Grand Marnier version is sometimes called a ""straight satan\'s whiskers.""\nIn the curled version, some people add as many as six dashes of orange bitters. One dash is also common in the straight drink.\nHow Strong Is a Satan\'s Whiskers Cocktail?\nThis cocktail is actually one of the more mild variations on the gin martini, and you can thank the orange juice for that. On average, it should shake up to around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). Keep in mind that it\'s almost twice the volume of similar drinks, so don\'t assume you won\'t get a little tipsy after a couple of rounds.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/satans-whiskers-recipe-760119

Some people enjoy gin rather than vodka.\nThe sloe comfortable screwdriver pours 1 ounce each of vodka and Southern Comfort, 1/2 ounce of sloe gin, and is filled with orange juice.\nFloating Galliano on top of the Southern Comfort variation adds ""against the wall"" to this drink\'s name. The addition refers to the Harvey Wallbanger, which gets the same finishing touch.\nThe next step is to add tequila. For this one, pour 1/2 ounce each of vodka, Southern Comfort, sloe gin, and tequila, fill with orange juice, then add a Galliano float.\nThe most complex and boozy of the lot finishes the name with ""between the sheets"" (a popular rum and brandy cocktail). To make it, combine 1/2 ounce each of vodka, Southern Comfort, sloe gin, rum, and brandy, then fill with orange juice.\nSimilar to the fuzzy navel, the drink gets ""fuzzy"" when peach schnapps is used. In this version, pour 1/2 ounce each of vodka, Southern Comfort, sloe gin, and peach schnapps, fill with orange juice and float Galliano.\nHow Strong Is a Sloe Screwdriver?\nSloe gin can be bottled anywhere between 15 percent and 30 percent ABV (30 to 60 proof). This will be a very light drink with an alcohol content around 7 percent ABV (14 proof) when made with the strongest sloe gin. While it\'s similar to high-point beer, that will go up, of course, if you add liquors for the variations.

It's a popular homemade ingredient for those lucky enough to be able to forage for the wildflowers. You can also find it or elderflower syrup (much sweeter) from a number of online or specialty stores.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you do not have or cannot find an elderflower cordial, St. Germain Liqueur is a fine substitute and a bottle that is very handy to have in the bar anyway.\nOne suggested variation on this recipe replaces the elderflower cordial with a mint citrus syrup. It creates a completely different flavor but is also quite interesting. You likely won't find this particular flavor at stores, so will have to make it yourself. Luckily, the recipe for mint citrus syrup is very easy and should be ready to use in just over an hour.\nMezcal will add a smokiness to this cocktail. If you prefer, pour tequila instead. You won't miss much because there's already a lot of flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Dragon's Heart Cocktail?\nFilled with flavor and various liquors, this cocktail is also not the lightest drink you can mix up.

As the flame burns, sprinkle some grated cinnamon onto the flame (it should spark a little).\nClap your hands over the flame to put it out (double-check that it's extinguished) and give the drink a quick stir. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPour this drink into thick glassware so the heat of the flame doesn't crack the glass. Don't let it burn long, either. Even the thickest glass won't stand up to prolonged heat.\nAlways extinguish a flaming cocktail before drinking it!\nIf you're going to clap to put out the flame, be sure to roll back your sleeves. Blowing it out? Keep a safe distance when doing so and hold your hair back.\nThe actual amount of cream needed will depend on the diameter of your glass. The goal is to create a thin white layer over top of the entire drink.\nBoth the cream and the rum should want to float naturally on top of the other ingredients because of their specific gravity. It's pretty easy, even if you've never layered a cocktail before. A little practice can help, though.\nRecipe Variation\nInstead of Ty Ku, you can pour any base liquor you like. Orange liqueurs (e.g., triple sec) will have a similar profile, though you could also go with citrus vodka. Neither of these options will add Ty Ku's green color, but that doesn't matter much because the coffee liqueur's so dark.\nHow Strong Is a Goblet of Fire?\nNot only is this a pretty cool drink that tastes good, but it's also a very potent brew.

Fill with ice.\nShake well to ensure the dairy is fully mixed into the drink.\nStrain into the prepared glass.\nSprinkle the top with freshly grated cinnamon to garnish. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe was created by Sailor Jerry Rum, so it's only natural that it is the recommended spiced rum for the pumpkin fever. It is a very good choice, though almost any spiced rum will make a fine substitute.\nPumpkin liqueurs can be tricky. It's a very seasonal liqueur and one that many liquor companies choose to avoid, despite its popularity. However, Bols Pumpkin Spice has been available for a number of years, and it is one of the best options on the market. It tends to start appearing on liquor store shelves in September and generally sticks around through the winter holidays.\nYou'll notice that the recipe calls for two dairy products. Cream is very heavy and thick while milk is relatively thin, so they balance out the cocktail's texture. You can replace these two ingredients with 1/2 ounce half-and-half (half cream and half milk) without altering the drink.\nCinnamon is a natural complement to the flavor of pumpkin, and it's a perfect garnish. Instead of grated cinnamon, you can also lay a whole cinnamon stick in the glass for a nice presentation. Also, mixing ground cinnamon into the sugar is a great way to upgrade the sweetened rim, if you choose to go that route.\nRecipe Variations\nAn aged rum can be used if you don't like the extra spices of spiced rum. Pouring aged rum will give the drink a nice depth of flavor and allow the pumpkin liqueur to take over for the missing spices.\nAs an alternative to a liqueur, you can use a pumpkin spice syrup. It is typically easy to find in the coffee sweetener section of larger grocery stores during the autumn months because it's the key ingredient for pumpkin spiced lattes. It may be a little sweeter than a liqueur, though, so consider pouring just 1/2 to 3/4 ounce in the pumpkin fever.\nHow Strong Is a Pumpkin Fever Cocktail?\nThe pumpkin fever may be delicious and creamy, but it's also a rather potent drink. It actually stacks up to other drinks in the martini family with an average alcohol content of 22 percent ABV (44 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pumpkin-fever-recipe-760476

You can make it at home or buy it online and from well-stocked liquor stores.\nDon't overpour the absinthe, just a dash will do. Adding too much can quickly overpower the drink with its anise flavor and it will be difficult to bring it back into balance.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer (or simply don't have it), skip the absinthe. You can also use other anise-flavored liqueurs such as Herbsaint, ouzo, raki, and sambuca as a substitute.\nTypically, it's not recommended to substitute Yellow Chartreuse for Green. The two liqueurs use different herbs and spices in the recipes and Green is considerably stronger, so it will not get lost in the drink. However, if Yellow Chartreuse is the only option in your bar, it may work rather well in this cocktail, so go ahead and try it.\nHow Strong Is a Lady Liberty Cocktail?\nThe Lady Liberty is filled with flavor (and alcohol) but it's not too bad when it comes to the strength. This cocktail should mix up to 19 percent ABV (38 proof) or so. While that's strong compared to the average highball, it is lighter than martini style drinks.

It's also good to adjust these to your taste.\nWhen making the sangria in advance, add the soda just before you're ready to serve.\nWhile sangria is not often served with ice in the glass, it is a nice option with a quick sangria like this recipe.

Squeeze in the juice from one wedge of each fruit, then top it off with 1 1/2 ounces soda, and stir.\nDress up the punch with extra fruits. Berries?particularly blueberries?are an excellent match for both mango and peach and give the sangria a pop of color. A sprig of mint in each glass is a good choice as well.\nSwitch from mango to coconut rum; it pairs just as well with peach.\nHow Strong Is the Peach and Mango Sangria?\nCounterbalanced by the fruit juices and soda, the two liqueurs in this sangria are sweet, fruity, and low-proof. This helps keep the sangria's alcohol content pleasantly light, at 11 percent ABV (22 proof). The strength is actually similar to the average wine.\nWhat is the best white wine for sangria?\nDry white wines are often a good choice for sangria because they offset the sweetness and create a balanced punch. Pinot grigio, riesling, and sauvignon blanc are excellent options. A dry ros? would work well, too, and a sparkling ros? could replace this sangria's soda.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/white-peach-sangria-recipe-760489

Follow this advice for the least amount of dilution, but try it using the recipe's recommended approach as well. The extra water can help marry the drink's distinct flavors.\nFor the fruit, have fun with unique combinations of strawberry, lime, orange, kiwi, passion fruit, or whatever catches your eye at the market. Cut it up so it's easier to muddle, and don't worry too much about getting exactly 1/2 cup. For instance, add one sliced strawberry with a lime wedge and a few cubes of passion fruit.\nThe most common Spanish brandy is Brandy de Jerez. It is differentiated from other brandies primarily in its production, including the soleras system that moves portions of the brandy to other barrels while aging and the use of former bourbon barrels that have also housed sherry. While this gives it a distinct flavor and it is an excellent choice, at just 1/2 ounce pour, any brandy will do just fine in this sangria.\nHow Strong Is a Brazilian Sangria?\nThere is a lot of liquor in this sangria, which means it will not be a light drink.

It was the best-known high-proof rum and used for all sorts of flaming tricks that sometimes got dangerous. In 2016, the rum was discontinued.\nAs an alternative, Cruzan, Don Q, and Gosling's all make rums bottled at 151 proof. None of them should be drunk straight because they're simply too strong in both alcohol and the burn.\nFor the dark rum, you'll find plenty of options at the liquor store. You can spend as little or as much as you like on a bottle, though the higher-end options will be more versatile and can be used to make some really nice mixed drinks.\nChill your glasses before pouring the shot to make it go down a little smoother.\nRecipe Variations\nThe triple sec doesn't make a big impact in this shot, so if you're out, just skip it. Alternatively, any other orange liqueur will work.\nIf you run out of either of the juices, just pour 4 ounces of the other. You can also use any tropical fruit juice blend that has a focus on orange, pineapple, or both.\nAged rums are a good alternative to dark rum, though they don't have quite the same flavor profile.

Fill the shaker with ice and shake for another 30 seconds to ensure the egg is thoroughly mixed.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk for foodborne illness.\nTips\nAs with any cocktail that includes an egg, you really need to shake it longer and harder than normal. Shake the drink for at least 30 seconds, or until the shaker is too cold to handle.\nIt\'s also important to ensure you\'re using only fresh eggs. There\'s a quick water test you can do before cracking the egg: Fill a glass with water and drop the egg in. If it sinks to the bottom, the egg is fresh. Those that float all the way to the top are too old (even for cooking) and should be tossed.\nIf you want to use simple syrup rather than granulated sugar, keep it to a dash as well. The equivalent of 1/2 teaspoon of sugar is 1/8 ounce of simple syrup, so just a small splash will do.\nHow Strong Is a Commodore Cocktail?\nAs far as its strength goes, the commodore falls in line with other fruity martini-style cocktails. When made with Bacardi Superior (the brand\'s standard white rum), it shakes up to 22 percent ABV (44 proof) or so. That\'s pretty strong, so don\'t let the sweet taste trick you into having more than you might intend to drink.\nRecipe Variation\nThe commodore no. 2 is quite a bit different than the commodore [no. 1]. With only two common ingredients, grenadine and lemon juice, it is amazing that the two share a name. This is evidence that even in the early 1900s bartenders were creating drinks and duplicating names?something that is far more common today. This commodore is an equal blend of bourbon, lemon, and cr?me de cacao. It sounds ""interesting"" but is worth trying because it is quite spectacular.\nTo make the drink, shake 1 ounce each of bourbon, cr?me de cacao, and lemon juice with a dash of grenadine. Strain the drink into a chilled Champagne glass.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/commodore-2-cocktail-recipe-760511

Mix, then muddle well.\nAdd the cacha?a and lime juice, then fill the shaker with ice.\nShake vigorously.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lime twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe variety of cacha?as available is growing as the worldwide distribution of the spirit expands. If you're going to venture beyond the Leblon suggestion, ensure the cacha?a you choose is high quality for a better drink.\nFresh lime juice is recommended and, since you need to muddle a lime anyway, there is really no excuse for not using it. You should be able to get 1 ounce out of a single lime unless the fruit is small.\nA lime twist is just like cutting a spiral of lemon peel. Actually, the smaller fruit tends to hold the twist better. The peel is naturally tighter than large lemons which can require a little finesse and squeeze to keep the shape.\nRecipe Variations\nA sour mix can make a nice caipirini, especially if it's homemade. To retain that lime dominance, consider making your sour mix a little heavier on the lime or skipping the lemon entirely. It is sweetened, so use less sugar or syrup.\nClear cacha?a is not your only option. Try it with an aged cacha?a and enjoy the additional nuance of wood undertones imparted by the barrel. Novo Fogo is one brand that specializes in various types of wood barrels and each expression has an entirely new profile to contribute to cocktails.\nIf you run out of cacha?a, a high-end white rum would be the best substitute. Essentially, you'll be making a cocktail similar to the daiquiri.\nHow Strong Is a Caipirini?\nThe caipirini stands up to the majority of martini-style cocktails when it comes to its strength. On average, it will mix up to 20 percent ABV (40 proof), so drinking two caipirinis successively would be like taking a straight shot of cacha?a.

Remove from the heat.\nAdd agave nectar (simple syrup may be used) and stir well.\nAllow it to steep for a few hours and test for flavor. Let it go longer if needed.\nWhen the desired flavor is achieved, strain out the seeds and bottle. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nMake the Coriandrum Cocktail\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the vodka, dry vermouth, coriander nectar, and orange bitters. Fill with ice.\nShake for 30 seconds.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a few coriander seeds and a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nDo not confuse coriander seeds with cilantro leaves. The two may come from the same plant but have entirely different flavors. Coriander tastes like sage, caraway, and lemon rolled into one, while cilantro has a lemon-pepper flavor that will likely be too strong for this drink. Some people even detect the taste of soap in cilantro or have a general dislike for it, so it's not an option if you want a drink that will appeal to everyone.\nRecipe Variations\nAdd dimension to the coriander nectar by bringing in a complementary flavor. Pieces of cucumber, ginger, lemongrass, or mint make a fine pairing with the seeds and can be added to the water. You can also squeeze in a little lemon or lime.\nNearly any herb or spice can be used to flavor the nectar and create a custom vodka martini. Simply follow the same steps to create the infused water using your herb of choice. Basil, cardamom, lavender, oregano, rosemary, and sage would be excellent starting points.\nHow Strong Is a Coriandrum?\nAside from the fruitiest recipes, most vodka martinis are very strong drinks and the Coriandrum is no exception. This one will mix up to 28 percent ABV (56 proof), which is over half the strength of the vodka on its own. Take it easy and savor the flavor.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/coriandrum-cocktail-recipe-761035

Fill it with ice.\nStir well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish by dropping cranberries into the glass. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSince this recipe is so simple, it will really show off the vodka. That\'s why you\'ll want to select a top-shelf vodka that is nice and smooth with a clean taste. Luckily, there are a ton of worthy options on the market today, so you have plenty of bottles to choose from.\nThere are a few companies that make delicious cranberry liqueurs. Look for brands like Clear Creek, Leopold Brothers, and Wild Moon to get the best-tasting crantini.\nCranberries come into season during the fall months and you can usually find them through the winter holidays. It\'s a perfect time to use them for garnishing or dry them for future use. You can also put the sweet little fruits to use and make your own cranberry liqueur.\nDried cranberries are readily available at grocery stores and you might recognize them under the brand name ""Craisins."" They work as a substitute garnish but do not expect them to float like fresh cranberries.\nRecipe Variations\nSince cranberry is not one of the most common liqueurs and can be hard to find at times, you can also use cranberry juice as a substitute.\nIf you go the juice route, you may want to add a little simple syrup to this cocktail. Begin with 1/4 ounce and give the drink a taste to see what you think. You can always add more next time you mix it up.\nHow Strong Is a Crantini?\nThe crantini is going to be a potent little cocktail. With the average vodka and Leopold Bros. New England Cranberry, it mixes up to 30 percent ABV (60 proof), one of the strongest vodka martinis you\'ll find. With the juice option, the strength is knocked down to 25 percent ABV (50 proof), which is as strong as the average cosmo.

The other option is to split it into two smaller glasses, even pouring it into cocktail glasses if you like.\nRecipe Variations\nPlay up that witch's brew concept by adding a few berries, grapes, or apple slices to the blender for even more unknown creature bodies inside your brew. Adding a lychee eyeball once the drink's in the glass ups the creepy factor.\nPour vodka of any flavor to add an extra dimension. Any fruit vodka will pair nicely with the cranberry juice.\nYou can also have fun with dark-colored vodkas like espresso or chocolate vodka, or a deep purple vodka like Van Gogh A?ai-Blueberry. Blavod is a black vodka that will really add a spooky twist. UV Vodka's colored vodkas (particularly UV Blue and UV Green) can add some extra fun, too.\nVodka is not required! Switch out the liquor if you want. Rum and tequila are perfect choices for this drink.\nSimilarly, you can use any fruit juice you want. Take the frog in a blender concept and just roll with it to create your own custom mix!\nHow Strong Is a Frog in a Blender?\nThe frog in a blender is a relatively light cocktail.

If you don\'t have one of that volume, strain it into a rocks glass or a couple of smaller shot glasses instead.\nWhen you\'re sharing with friends, go ahead and shake up a few shots at once. Line up shot glasses on the counter, increase the ingredients in proportion for the servings you need, shake it up and strain as you move the shaker down the line.\nThis shot is just a little better when served in chilled shot glasses. Keep a few in the freezer so they\'re always ready and frosty when you need them.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you like the taste of the cool colada, don\'t reserve it for a shooter.

That does make this shot a little less potent, but it\'s still pretty strong. On average, its alcohol content should be in the 21 percent ABV (42 proof) range, so two of these shots would equal one of full-strength vodka.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cool-colada-shooter-recipe-761034

They will float on top of the drink and, in the Italian tradition, represent health, happiness, and prosperity.\nYou have quite a few options when it comes to choosing the cream. A standard cream will create a rich drink, though you could pour milk and even opt for skim milk for a nice, light drink.\nHalf and half will give you some of the richness of cream with a softer, milk-like mouthfeel. It's always a good middle-of-the-road choice for cream cocktails.\nIf you prefer, this martini can be made with dairy alternatives. Almond milk would be one of the best complements to the martini's flavors. Cashew and soy are nice options, too.\nEspresso Vodka\nThis martini recipe was one of the first created by Van Gogh Vodka to promote their espresso vodkas' release in 2008. It quickly became a hit and is one of the best ways to enjoy the rich coffee flavors. The brand also offers Espresso Vodka if you want something that's a little less intense.\nA number of other vodka brands, including Three Olives, Sobieski, and Smirnoff, produce espresso vodkas as well. You can even find intriguing flavor blends like Crater Lake's Hazelnut Espresso Vodka. Any of these would make an excellent golden cappuccino martini.\nDIY Coffee Vodka\nFor drinkers who enjoy a DIY project, it's incredibly easy to make your own coffee-flavored vodka. Whole or coarsely ground coffee beans infuse into vodka just as easily as they do in the water when making cold brew coffee.\nSimilar to this coffee bourbon recipe, the infusion should take just a day or so to reach the ideal flavor. It's one of the quicker liquor infusions you can make at home. The best part is that you can customize it with your favorite vodka and coffee bean roast.\nHow Strong Is a Golden Cappuccino Martini?\nLike most flavored vodkas, Van Gogh's are bottled at 70 proof, so this martini starts out a little lighter than most. With all that cream, its alcohol content is a gentle 16 percent ABV (32 proof). That's just a little stronger than a glass of wine and one of the lightest vodka martinis you'll find.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/golden-cappuccino-martini-761064

Quite often, you'll see them pop up in liquor stores around the holidays when people get cravings for gingerbread.\nHiram Walker and Kahlua are two well-known brands that have produced gingerbread liqueurs. However, neither is produced every year. From the United Kingdom, you can find the liqueur from brands like Pennington's. Mr. Stack's is an inexpensive brand that's sold at some online liquor stores, and Massenez Cr?me de Gingerbread is a premium option. Others may come and go on the market, so keep an eye out for any new gingerbread spirits and give them a try.\nSome gingerbread liqueurs will be sweeter than others, so skip the simple syrup if needed.\nRecipe Variations\nIn a pinch, you can also use a gingerbread syrup. Intended to flavor coffee, syrup companies like DaVinci, Monin, and Torani offer the flavor. In this case, skip the cocktail's plain simple syrup or the drink will be too sweet.\nIf you feel like an adventure, take that gingerbread syrup and make your own liqueur. Brandy would be a fantastic base for your experiments.\nHow Strong Is a Gingerbread Man-tini?\nThe gingerbread man-tini stacks up to other vodka martinis.

The mix is so transparent that you will taste any impurities in the vodka, so try to stick with premium vodkas or those you wouldn't mind drinking straight.\nLikewise, fresh-squeezed lemonade is going to make a better tasting cocktail. It's as easy as mixing 1 part each simple syrup and lemon juice with two parts water. You can even make a single glass by shaking it up with ice.\nAnother advantage to homemade lemonade is that you can control the sweet and sour flavors to suit your taste by adding more syrup or juice. Many of the bottled lemonades are either too sweet or too sour, which can easily throw off the cocktail's balance.\nRecipe Variations\nThis is an ideal recipe to transform into a simple punch. Simply increase the ingredients for the number of servings needed. You can make it a little lighter (so your guests don't get too tipsy) by pouring 1 part each Ty Ku and vodka and 2 or 3 parts lemonade. It also makes an excellent pre-mixed drink if you keep a pitcher in the refrigerator.\nAdd a little sparkle with a splash of club soda or use a sparkling lemonade.\nIf you cannot find Ty Ku, there's no really good substitute.

Some of the softer gins can't stand up against an espresso vodka (particularly the darker offerings) and will get lost.\nFor a real boost, try a Navy strength gin or similarly high-proof option because they tend to have an even stronger flavor profile.\nIf you don't make a lot of martinis, check the freshness of your vermouth. The fortified wine does not have the long shelf life of other bottles in the bar. It will go bad after a few months of being open and is best when stored in the refrigerator.\nRecipe Variation\nNo espresso vodka?

Cold brew coffee is a great alternative to espresso if you don't have a machine at home because it offers a full, rich flavor of coffee beans.\nHow Strong Is a Ginspresso Martini?\nQuite often, flavored vodkas are bottled at 70 proof rather than 80 proof and that's the case for most espresso vodkas. Pairing that with an 80-proof gin will create a pretty strong drink and the ginspresso martini does weigh in at a hefty 29 percent ABV (58 proof). It's in line with liquor-only martinis and as delightful as they are, it can be tempting to drink one too many.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ginspresso-martini-761063

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis version uses slightly more vodka than called for in the original recipe because it's a little easier to pour a full shot. You can certainly pour less if you like, though most drinkers tend to enjoy a longer shot than a short one anyway. Make it however you like, it will be great either way.\nChambord is the recommended brand for the drink's liqueur. Its sweet black raspberry flavor is the perfect complement to the sweet tartness of the lemonade. You could, however, choose any of the other raspberry or blackberry liqueurs that are available.\nThe use of fresh-squeezed lemonade cannot be stressed enough for any cocktail. Many of the premade lemonades are too sweet for mixed drinks, and they can quickly throw off the balance of flavors.\nThe melon garnish is a real treat and summer is the perfect time to take advantage of this fresh fruit. All you need is honeydew and a melon baller. It's even better when you skewer the melon balls then toss them in the freezer for about an hour. They'll be nice and frosty and help keep your drink cool.\nRecipe Variations\nGrey Goose Vodka sponsors this drink so it's only natural that it is the recommended brand for the honey deuce. While you can certainly use any vodka you like, it would be best with one of equal quality to Grey Goose. After all, if you're making the effort to mix Chambord and fresh lemonade, there's no reason to pour a subpar vodka.\nYou may also want to play with flavored vodkas. Just a hint of a complementary flavor can add a nice flair to simple cocktails like this. Try berries, citrus, melon, or even cucumber and see what you think.\nHow Strong Is a Honey Deuce?\nThe honey deuce is a surprisingly light drink, even with a little extra vodka. It should have an alcohol content in the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range, making it the same as a very light wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/honey-deuce-cocktail-recipe-761079

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf the mix is too thick, add a little extra vodka or chocolate liqueur (milk is also an option). When it\'s too thin for your liking, add either ice or ice cream and blend again.\nYou\'ll have a pretty tall drink if you follow the recipe, so you may want to split it with that special someone!\nThe recipe recommends white cr?me de cacao because the clear liqueur will retain the drink\'s pink colors from the strawberries.\nWhile clear vodka is good in this cocktail, you\'ll likely find that either the strawberry or vanilla vodka options are better. Both flavored vodkas are readily available on the market and either is an easy infusion to do at home as well. You will just need to allow 3 to 5 days to make the infusions.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many other chocolate liqueurs available, but the darker ones will make the blend look muddy. This is not a bad thing, necessarily, because one of the best versions is made with Godiva Liqueur and the rich chocolate flavor makes up for the color. Godiva also makes a white chocolate liqueur.\nHave fun with the ice cream! Vanilla is a standard go-to in ice cream cocktails, but there are so many more possibilities. Try vanilla with a fudge swirl or switch to chocolate or a fruity ice cream.\nStrawberries are an aphrodisiac, so a natural choice for this ""love potion."" Add other types of berries to the blender if you like, or go with that never-fail combination of strawberries and bananas for a fun twist.\nHow Strong Is a Love Potion #9?\nJust how light is this love potion? While it will depend on the vodka you pour, when made with a flavored vodka (typically 70 proof), it blends up to a delicate 4 percent ABV (8 proof).

Muddle gently.\nAdd the vodka and sake, and fill with ice.\nShake vigorously until the outside of the shaker is frosted and beaded with sweat.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a sliced pear. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nLychees can be found in cans or jars, typically in international food markets or that section of major grocers.\nYou can also prepare fresh lychees when you find them. You will have to peel the bumpy ""alligator skin"" that covers the fleshy fruit and remove the stone before using them.\nIf you prefer, use 1/2 tablespoon white granulated sugar rather than simple syrup.\nFor the pear garnish, dip freshly cut pear in lemon juice. This will stop the fruit\'s flesh from turning yellow-brown due to oxidation.\nRecipe Variations\nLychee liqueur can be used as a substitute for the lychee. In this case, muddle the lime and syrup, then add about 1/2 ounce of lychee liqueur along with the vodka and sake. You may only need half the syrup the recipe requires because the liqueur will add sweetness.\nAdd a little sparkling wine, if you like. Strain the drink into an old-fashioned glass and top it with 1 or 2 ounces of wine for a refreshing spin. A beautiful ros? wine would be perfect for this mix because it tends to have strawberry flavors that perfectly complement lychee and pear.\nBoth the lychee liqueur and sparkling wine are fabulous options if you want to transform the martini into a pitcher drink. The recipe will need some adjustments, though the flavor profile will remain the same. For instance, you might pour 1 cup each of pear vodka and sake, 1/2 cup lychee liqueur, 1 ounce simple syrup, the juice of 2 limes, and half a bottle of sparkling wine. Mix it up with ice and adjust it to taste. Its alcohol content will be similar to wine, about 16 percent ABV, perfectly casual for a party.\nHow Strong Is a Lotus Blossom Martini?\nLike many fruity vodka martinis, this is not necessarily a light drink and that sweet taste can be deceiving. Grey Goose bottles their flavored vodkas at a full 80-proof, and with that, the cocktail will shake up to 21 percent ABV (42 proof). That\'s about the same as a cosmopolitan.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lotus-blossom-cocktail-recipe-761101

Swirl the liqueur around in the glass until the entire surface is evenly coated. Toss any excess limoncello.\nShake the vodka in a cocktail shaker filled with ice.\nStrain the shaken vodka into the coated cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe importance of pouring a top-shelf vodka cannot be stressed enough for this cocktail. It makes up the entire drink, so you should really like the vodka straight to get the most enjoyable experience.\nLimoncello is a sweet, thick lemon-flavored liqueur that is often used to top ice cream, so you know it makes some very delicious drinks. It is best when kept chilled in the freezer.\nMaking limoncello at home is very easy, but it's not a quick process. It is one of the longest infusion times for liquors and will take almost three months for the flavor to fully develop. If you're patient, you'll find that it's well worth the wait!\nChilling your glass will improve this lemontini considerably and keep it nice and cold. If you don't have room in the freezer for cocktail glasses, the quickest way to cool it down is to place a few ice cubes in the glass then dump them out before making the martini.\nRecipe Variations\nBring back the vermouth if you like, but add it to the shaker with the vodka. It's a great way to add a hint of sweetness to the vodka martini; 1/2 ounce of dry vermouth creates a perfectly balanced cocktail.\nRim the glass with sugar before rinsing it with limoncello. Each sip will be just a little sweeter.\nNo limoncello? Mix up a lemon-flavored syrup to rinse the glass as a substitute. This can be as easy as adding a little lemon juice to simple syrup (essentially making a sour mix). You can also flavor simple syrup with the zest from a whole lemon while it's still hot and let the flavor infuse until it cools completely.\nIf you have a favorite flavored vodka, try it in the lemontini. Good options include any of the berry vodkas as well as citrus and coconut. Be sure to choose quality vodkas for the best results.\nHow Strong Is an In and Out Lemontini?\nThe in and out lemontini will be slightly lighter than the vodka you pour. Factoring in dilution from the shake and that splash of limoncello, this martini's alcohol content should be somewhere around 34 percent ABV (68 proof). Its sweet taste will mask the potency and it is a double shot of vodka, so be sure take it easy with this one.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/in-and-out-lemontini-761082

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a short black licorice stick. Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nWhen shaking with sambuca (or any anise-flavored liqueur), be sure to wash the cocktail shaker and any utensils very well. If you don't eliminate any leftover flavor, it can easily be picked up in the next drink you mix.\nWhite sambuca is clear in color, though the liqueur is also available in other colors that will change the look, but not the flavor, of this martini. The other most common option is black sambuca, though you can also find red sambuca.\nA cocktail glass is not deep, so cut your licorice stick in half (or a third) so the garnish is sized appropriately for the glass. A fun alternative is to wrap an entire stick of licorice around the inside of the glass to create a black spiral.\nRecipe Variations\nTry this cocktail with espresso vodka. The flavors of coffee and sambuca are a perfect pairing and the flavored vodka adds an interesting twist to the licorice stick.\nSome sambucas are also flavored with red berries, typically cherry or raspberry. Use this pairing as inspiration and try the licorice stick with vodkas flavored with those fruits as well.\nHow Strong Is a Licorice Stick Cocktail?\nSambuca is bottled at a minimum of 76 proof, though many brands are stronger than that. Taking the average of 80-proof and pairing it with vodka of equal strength will result in a very strong cocktail that rivals its pronounced flavor. The licorice stick's alcohol content can easily reach 35 percent ABV (70 proof), making this one of the strongest mixed drinks available.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/licorice-stick-cocktail-recipe-761099

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo reduce the spice a bit, be sure to remove the white flesh inside the pepper as well as all of the seeds as these contain the real heat of the jalape?o. Without them, the pepper is actually quite mild, similar to what you get when making jalape?o poppers.\nFine straining this drink is essential because that second strainer will catch all the bits of pepper and leave you with a clean drink.\nMango nectar is relatively easy to find. Grocery stores usually stock 12-ounce cans of nectar near the fruit juices and mango's a popular flavor.\nFor the lime juice, you can simply squeeze the juice from one lime directly into the shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nUsing a citrus garnish, such as a lime slice or wedge, is a great alternative to the pepper. It also allows you to squeeze in more juice or wipe the rim for a little more lime taste if you like.\nIf you like, make your own mango-infused vodka. It's very easy: cut one fresh mango into chunks, place them in an infusion jar, and fill with vodka. Allow it to rest for about one week or until the flavor reaches your desired intensity, then strain out the mango and bottle the vodka.\nUse small sweet peppers instead of jalape?o to create a drink that's more savory than spicy.\nHow Strong Is a Mango Spice Cocktail?\nAbsolut bottles their flavored vodkas at a full 80 proof rather than the 70 proof that's standard with commercial infusions. That helps boost the flavor, but since it is the only liquor in this recipe, it's lighter than most vodka martinis. On average, the mango spice will mix up to just 14 percent ABV (28 proof), nearly half of drinks like the cosmopolitan. It's actually more along the lines of wine, only this cocktail has a lot more flavor.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/absolut-mango-spice-cocktail-761105

This is a drink that can easily be made using your ""well"" liquor, which can save some money.\nSour mix is an essential bar ingredient and it\'s easy to make at home. Essentially, it\'s just a simple syrup made with lemon and lime juices (or either citrus). There\'s even a way to make it instantly in a cocktail shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to bring tequila back into the mix, use it to replace any of the liquors.\nThe Miami iced tea sometimes gets confused with the Miami Beach iced tea. While that recipe is similar, the major difference is that the ""beach"" version is blue, which is why it\'s also called electric iced tea.\nIt\'s easy to transform this drink into a big-batch cocktail that can be mixed up by the pitcher. Simply combine all of the ingredients, multiplying them by the number of servings you want. Stir it and store the punch in the refrigerator until needed.

You\'ll be surprised when you do the math, however.\n\nThe total volume of liquor is just 2 1/2 ounces, which is like a tall shot of a single liquor.

The average orange yields about 2 to 3 ounces of juice, which is more than enough for a few Mexi-tinis.\nAdd more orange juice if you like, the recommended amount is enough to marry the two spirits but can leave the drink a little dull. An extra 1/2 ounce can help out significantly.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you don't have an orange vodka, any citrus vodka will make a fine substitute.\nYou might find that this drink needs just a hint of sweetness. Adding 1/2 ounce of simple syrup can really bring a nice balance to the cocktail.\nTake a hint from the tequila sunrise and add a small amount of grenadine to the Mexi-tini. You'll add a fruity sweetness and have a beautiful visual effect in your glass if you pour the grenadine after straining the cocktail.\nPouring reposado tequila is another nice option. The oak undertones from the lightly aged tequila will add a little more dimension to this drink.\nSince you're adding a flavored vodka, why not try a custom tequila infusion as well? It's a fun project that can result in some interesting tastes, especially if you think outside the box with something like lemongrass-ginger tequila.\nIf tequila isn't your thing, replace it with gin. The spirit's botanicals work really well with fresh orange flavors, as seen in the classic orange blossom cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Mexi-tini?\nWhenever you pour two shots of full-proof liquor into a drink and just a small amount of nonalcoholic mixers, you should expect it to be rather strong.

It's also easy to make homemade coffee liqueur, though you'll need to plan for a 10-day infusion.\nSwitch the vodka out for a vanilla rum or whiskey if you like. The flavor is relatively easy to find in both spirits and will add more dimension to the cocktail's taste.\nCoffee (most often espresso) vodka is an alternative to the coffee liqueur.

Simply increase the ingredients according to the number of servings you need.\nIf you want to skip muddling the raspberries (a good idea for a pitcher), use them to make a flavored simple syrup. This ingredient can be added to the drink?about 1/2 ounce for a single cocktail?or used in place of plain simple syrup when mixing the lemonade (creating raspberry lemonade).\nAdd a little more dimension to this drink's flavor by muddling a handful of mint leaves with the raspberries. You could also add lime wedges for a mojito-like twist.\nHow Strong Is a Raspberry Vodka Lemonade Cocktail?\nThe majority of citrus vodkas are bottled at 70 proof though a few are 80 proof. Whichever you choose, the high volume of lemonade brings the cocktail down to the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range.

If you choose wisely, there are some great budget-friendly vodkas available and you can save the really good stuff for your fancier martinis.\nThe melon liqueur: Midori is, by far, the most famous melon liqueur in today's market, and it is a perfect choice for Pearl Harbor. If you can't find Midori, Bols Melon is another great option.\nThe juice: If you can, use fresh pineapple juice. But because juicing a pineapple requires an electric juicer, use organic unsweetened pineapple juice?look for the smallest quantity available as it doesn't store well. Most stores sell 6 to 8-ounce cans in packs of six or more. Unless you are going to use a lot of pineapple juice at one time, this simple choice will make sure that your drinks are fresh and you are not wasting juice.\nFlavored Vodka\nSome suggest mixing this drink with pineapple vodka, and although it makes a good drink, it can be too much pineapple flavor. If you do want to play with flavored vodka, try something that isn't an exact match to the drink's flavors. A light berry flavor or cucumber vodka makes a very interesting base against the tropical fruits.\nHow Strong Is the Pearl Harbor?\nLet's assume that we fill our glass with 4 ounces of pineapple juice. In this case, the Pearl Harbor is a relatively light drink, weighing in at just around 15 percent ABV (30 proof). Of course, if we were to pour a little less juice, it would be stronger; add a little more and the drink will be lighter. Either way, this drink is not much stronger than similar drinks like the madras.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pearl-harbor-cocktail-761128

You can opt for one of the better-known brands like Chopin, Grey Goose, and Ketel One, or explore some of the impressive craft vodkas available today. If it's a vodka you wouldn't mind sipping straight, it will make a great martini.\nYour choice of orange liqueur should be considered just as carefully. Steer clear of cheap bottles of triple sec and cura?ao and spend a little more for an upgrade. Brands like Cointreau, Marie Brizard, and Grand Marnier are great options, though there are many more. Keep in mind that you'll use orange liqueur quite often?from margaritas to mimosas?and a small investment can improve countless cocktails.\nObviously, the Pama martini was designed to be made with that brand specifically, but there are other nice options. Pomegranate has become one of the hottest flavors in the bar over the years and distillers have done a fine job following this trend. Explore your local liquor store's offerings and try out any brands that may be unfamiliar to you. Chateau Pomari, Gabriel Boudier, and Giffard are a few worthy pomegranate liqueurs to consider.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you don't have pomegranate liqueur, you can turn to that trusted bottle of grenadine to make a pomegranate martini. The syrup will be sweeter and more concentrated than the liqueur, so you need to use less. Shake 1 1/2 ounces of vodka, 3/4 ounce of orange liqueur, and 3/4 ounce of grenadine. Adjust the ingredients to your taste.\nYou can also try your hand at making your own pomegranate liqueur. It's no more difficult than any other homemade liqueur and can even be as simple as making grenadine, then adding 1 cup or more to a bottle of vodka to suit your taste. You'll find it to be a fun experiment when pomegranates are in season.\nHow Strong Is a Pama Martini?\nAs you'll find with most martinis, the Pama martini is a pretty strong drink. When made with an 80-proof vodka, the alcohol content should fall into the 25 percent ABV (50 proof) range. Of course, that's perfectly normal for this style of cocktail and, if you've ever had one too many cosmopolitans, you know that the alcohol can sneak up on you, so be careful.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pama-martini-recipe-761124

The volume in the recipe is just a suggestion, though you may enjoy it with more or less.\nSince the fruit flavors of this cocktail are rather strong, there's really no need to pour the best vodka in your bar. Instead, this is a perfect drink to save a little cash by using one of the better-tasting cheap vodkas on the market.\nIf you need a substitute for Cointreau, try triple sec or orange cura?ao. Grand Marnier can be a nice option as well, though its brandy base will darken the drink's profile slightly. That's not necessarily a bad thing!\nThe pink flamingo is a great recipe to transform into a big-batch cocktail. Simply keep the ingredient ratio the same to fill a pitcher or punch bowl. You can even make it ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator.\nRecipe Variations\nUV Vodka created a martini-like pink flamingo that is very similar to this recipe in taste. The recipe features UV Lemonade (a pink, lemonade-flavored vodka) with cranberry juice and triple sec.\nOther versions of the pink flamingo include vanilla schnapps or grenadine instead of the orange liqueur and sloe gin, respectively. Another adds a little cream or cream of coconut for a rendition similar to the orange creamsicle.\nThere's also a pink flamingo that splits the orange juice equally with lemonade. It tends to use grenadine or another red fruit-flavored simple syrup, like strawberry or raspberry, instead of sloe gin.\nYou might even want to try substituting the vodka for either coconut or pineapple rum (or the vodka versions of the two flavors).\nTo add a little sparkle, finish the drink off with a lemon-lime soda like Sprite.\nHow Strong Is a Pink Flamingo?\nThe amount of orange juice you actually end up pouring will affect the final alcohol content of your pink flamingo. And yet, this is generally going to be a relatively light mixed drink. When made according to the recipe, it weighs in around 19 percent ABV (38 proof), which is perfectly casual and only slightly stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pink-flamingo-cocktail-recipe-761131

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo keep your shandy cold on a warm day, be sure to use a frosty pint glass or beer mug. Storing these glasses in the freezer is a great way to ensure you always have one on hand.\nRecipe Variations\nThis basic recipe has a lot of room for experimentation, and there are lots of shandy recipes to keep you refreshed throughout the summer. Try them all and have fun giving it a personal spin!\nOne popular variation is the radler, which has German origins. It can be made in a few different ways, but typically replaces the shandy's lemonade with a fruit soda (often citrus sodas like grapefruit or lemon-lime) or ginger ale. Again, the mix is equal parts of beer and soda.\nThe British shandy pours equal parts of beer and lemon-lime soda.\nYou can also pour equal parts lemonade and soda after filling the glass halfway with beer.\nMake your shandy just a little more interesting by adding extra fruit to the lemonade. For instance, you can sweeten lemonade with strawberry syrup instead of plain syrup. The same technique can be used with almost any fruit; berries, mango, and other citrus are great options.\nAnother fun idea is to create a lilac shandy. It's perfect for spring because it's made with fresh lilac syrup.\nThere's also no need to stick with lemonade. Try a grapefruit shandy, which uses homemade grapefruit-ade for a fun twist, or a basil-rosemary orange shandy that flavors orangeade with a custom simple syrup.\nLike your drinks spicy? This pineapple shandy with jalape?o syrup should be on your must-drink list.\nHow Strong Is a Shandy?\nEssentially, the final alcohol content of your shandy will be half the strength of whatever beer your pour. For example, if you choose Paulaner Hefeweizen (a very popular wheat beer that makes an excellent shandy), your drink will weigh in at just 2.75 percent ABV.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/easy-shandy-recipe-758997

Fill with ice.\nShake vigorously for at least 30 seconds.\nFine-strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a sprig of fresh dill or tarragon and a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nHow to Make Honey Syrup\nHoney syrup is a fantastic way to sweeten any drink and it is very easy to make at home. It replaces the sugar in a standard simple syrup with sweet honey and simply combines it with water. Just like simple syrup, honey syrup can also be flavored to add a little dimension. To make honey syrup, combine 3 parts honey and 1 part water, mixing together until the honey is incorporated. Mix up as little or as much as you like. With a big batch put it in a small saucepan over low heat to help speed things up and let it cool completely before using.\nTips\nThe best Ruby Queen uses fresh beet juice. Most electric juicers will make short work of the root vegetable and create a luscious, thick red juice in just minutes. There are ways to make it without a juicer as well.\nThe alternative is to buy bottled beet juice. It's sometimes mixed with fruits and vegetables and those blends work rather well in this drink.\nWhether or not you juice your own beets, it would be a shame to use anything other than fresh lemon juice in this cocktail. The citrus balance is needed to make the drink more enjoyable and it is difficult to find that in any of the prepared lemon juices. Lemons are cheap and juicing them is easy, so fresh is always the best route.\nIt is always tempting to skip the garnish in cocktails, particularly if you are just making the drink for yourself at home. The Ruby Queen is one of those cocktails in which the garnish is essential. A lone sprig of dill or tarragon will slowly infuse an herbal aspect into the beet and whiskey mix that is needed to obtain the balance and bring the cocktail to a level of greatness. Basil and rosemary are good alternatives.\nHow Strong Is the Ruby Queen?\nThe Ruby Queen is a very tame and enjoyable cocktail. When made with 80 proof Scotch whisky, the final drink comes out at right around 13 percent ABV (26 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ruby-queen-cocktail-recipe-759220

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nOnce you open a bottle of club soda, it will go flat in a day, even if you seal it up tight. To prevent this and ensure that your mixed drinks are as effervescent as possible, consider using smaller bottles that hold enough soda for just a few drinks at a time.\nFresh lemon juice is going to create a better-tasting drink. Fortunately, you can just squeeze a little juice from half a lemon, so there are no special tools required. Use the remaining fruit to cut your garnish.\nIf you want a pop of color on the rim, use food coloring to turn your sugar pink! The method for coloring sugar is easy, though it's best to let it rest overnight so you will need to plan ahead.\nAbout Sweet Revenge Liqueur\nThis sweet strawberry liqueur is a good addition to any bar. Made with sour mash and natural fruit flavoring, Sweet Revenge is a fun spirit that can easily become your regular strawberry liqueur to use in a variety of cocktails. You'll find that it's not too sweet and will appreciate its natural wild strawberry flavor, which is fabulous with fresh-squeezed lemonade or straight and chilled as a sipper. It's definitely a nice alternative to many of the super sweet strawberry liqueurs on the market.\nSweet Revenge is produced in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was first released in 2012 and is bottled at 38.5 percent alcohol by volume (77 proof).\nRecipe Variations\nTransform the strawberry cure into a sparkling, spiked strawberry lemonade by adding an ounce or two of homemade lemonade.\nIf you run out of club soda, make this drink with any other light soda. Ginger ale and citrus sodas are perfect and will not alter the flavor too much.\nFor a fun change, switch to a cola instead and you'll have a Sweet Revenge and cola.\nAdd a flavored vodka to give this drink an extra kick. Grapefruit and raspberry are two excellent options.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Cure?\nDespite its bold flavor, the strawberry cure is a gentle cocktail. The mixed drink has an alcohol content around 11 percent ABV (22 proof), which is similar to a glass of wine. Do be careful, though. Sweet drinks like this can trick your taste buds into wanting more and a few rounds can add up, leaving you a little more intoxicated than you may like.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-revenges-strawberry-cure-recipe-759162

Make sure it hasn't been previously used for any non-food related items and that it's clean so as not to taint the spirit's flavor.\nYou can skip the spritzer but get the same effect. Simply pour a splash of the liqueur into the glass and swirl it around until the interior is coated. Dump out the excess. This method intensifies the Chartreuse flavor a bit, but that's not a bad thing.\nFor the bitters, there are a number of recipes online for homemade root beer bitters that you might want to try. One of the best commercial options is the Sasparilla Dry Bitters from Bad Dog Bar Craft.\nExplore your root beer options. Many of the best-known brands?Barq's, A&W, etc.?are good for root beer floats, but they're often very sugary. It's not hard to find really impressive root beers produced by small soda companies. These tend to be made with real cane sugar and have a nice balanced and natural flavor that is a better fit for cocktails.\nIf you don't have an orange, add a dash or two of orange bitters instead.\nRecipe Variations\nThere really are no good substitutes for either J?germeister or Chartreuse. That doesn't mean you can't have fun with other spirits in this recipe. Use it as inspiration to create your own version of a root beer float cocktail. For instance, whiskey, rum, or B?n?dictine, would be fun bases to use instead of J?ger. Instead of Chartreuse, try a spritz of amaretto or butterscotch or cinnamon schnapps.\nHow Strong Is the Inside Scoop?\nNot every drink made with J?germeister follows its notorious reputation for being a highly intoxicating liquor. The Inside Scoop is actually quite gentle and has a low alcohol content. On average, it will weigh in at just 8 percent ABV (16 proof), making it perfect for an afternoon treat.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/inside-scoop-cocktail-recipe-759156

It's a delicious drink, and RumChata is a perfect substitute for Irish cream.\nTips\nWhen it comes to banana liqueur, there are a number of options. Cr?me de banane and banana schnapps are the most popular. A well-stocked liquor store should have at least one banana option; 99 Bananas, DeKuyper, Hiram Walker, Bols, and Marie Brizard are some of the brand names to look for.\nMake sure your graham crackers are crushed as finely as possible so there are not obtrusive chunks on the rim. The easiest way to do this is to place a few crackers in a blender or food processor.\nPour a little of either liqueur into a shallow dish that's wide enough for the diameter of your glass. Quickly dip the rim into the liquid and, keeping the glass upside down, roll it in a plate of the prepared graham crackers.\nMake sure your glass is as cold as you can get it. Glass temperature really makes a difference with creamy drinks like this.\nHow Strong Is a Banana Cream Pie?\nThe two liqueurs that go into the banana cream pie are low proof, so this is going to be a gentle drink.

Fill with ice.\nStir well.\nStrain into a chilled coupe glass.\nGarnish with an orange twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe biggest consideration with sweet vermouth is that it's fresh. The fortified wine has a short shelf life of just three months once open. If you have to dust off your bottle or have not stored it in the refrigerator, it's likely time for a replacement.\nThough it's just a small amount, the quality of the orange cura?ao you pour makes a difference. Avoid the super cheap bottles and spend a little more on a premium brand instead. Look for brands like Senior Cura?ao of Cura?ao or Pierre Ferrand.\nBlue cura?ao is not a viable substitute. First of all, it will change the color of the drink and, secondly, it's often overly sweetened and artificially flavored. It would be better to pour Cointreau or Grand Marnier (neither of which is cura?ao, but you'll still get a quality orange liqueur).\nUnicum is best served chilled when drunk straight and even though the cocktail is shaken with ice, it really does need a frosty glass. The quickest method is to place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're mixing, then discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variation\nAs with any vermouth cocktail, adjust the ratio of the three ingredients to suit your personal taste. You may enjoy it a little more with extra sweet vermouth or cura?ao or may want to back off on either ingredient. Play with it to see discover what you enjoy most.\nHow Strong Is an Emperor Cocktail?\nUnicum is bottled at a full 80 proof, so it's not a light liqueur and creates some very flavorful cocktails.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe original recipe used a variation of Baileys that included ""a hint of mint chocolate,"" which is no longer produced. Regular Baileys will do just fine. To bring back those flavors, include the mint chocolate syrup or use regular chocolate syrup and add a drop or two of mint extract to the blender.\nBaileys added both iced coffee and espresso to this cocktail, though they\'re really not necessary. If you have both, make it as directed because the espresso float does look really neat. Otherwise, simply add an extra teaspoon of iced coffee to the blender.\nFor a really flavorful chilled coffee, try a cold brew. It\'s not iced coffee and the method used to make it produces a sweeter, richer flavor that\'s a true taste of the coffee bean, perfect for cold mixed drinks. It does, however, take at least 12 hours to brew, so plan ahead!\nGuinness Gelato\nGelato is often described as Italian ice cream. It often has a more intense flavor and a different texture than the ice cream you may be used to. Gelato is soft and creamy because it has more sugar and less air which produces fewer ice crystals.\nFinding Guinness gelato is not easy, though it is a flavor that some gelato shops play around with from time to time. In most cases, you\'ll find it easier to make it yourself. The catch is that you need an ice cream or gelato maker.\nWith that appliance, it\'s relatively easy to make your own Guinness gelato or ice cream. For a gelato, you will want to use an ice cream maker that also has a gelato setting because gelato is turned at a slower rate. Also, gelato recipes tend to skip the cream and focus on milk, so choose your base recipe accordingly.\nWhether you\'re making gelato or ice cream, getting the Guinness flavor into it is easy. For most standard ice cream recipes, you can simply add 1 to 1 1/2 cups of the stout. You might have to make a few adjustments depending on your recipe, but this formula should be a good start and the experiments are delicious.\nBuy Cuisinart Ice Cream and Gelato Maker at Amazon\nRecipe Variations\nBaileys makes a variety of flavored Irish creams that would be excellent in this recipe. The brand\'s chocolate cherry, pumpkin spice, and salted caramel liqueurs can give it a new spin. Some of these flavors don\'t stay around for long, though Baileys will often replace discontinued products with new flavors.\nIf you don\'t want to mess with the Guinness gelato and simply want to dive into a great frozen cocktail, try coffee or chocolate ice cream. You can also add an ounce or so of Guinness to the blender while making the drink.\nHow Strong Is a Baileys Irish Ice?\nThe Baileys Irish Ice will give you more of a coffee buzz than an alcohol buzz, which is why it\'s such a fun and tasty treat. Not accounting for the Guinness in the gelato, the alcohol content is somewhere under 3 percent ABV (6 proof). That\'s lighter than a beer, so there\'s no need to worry about getting tipsy with this drink (err, dessert).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/baileys-irish-ice-cocktail-759552

Giffard Abricot du Roussillon and Marie Brizard Apry are two popular options.\nRecipe Variations\nSome Valencia cocktail variations pour equal parts (1 ounce each) of apricot brandy, gin, and orange juice, then add a dash of lemon juice.\nTo make a Valencia cocktail no. 2 (or Valencia Royale) shake the same drink as above, strain it into a Champagne flute, then top it off with brut Champagne.\nThe Agua de Valencia (""Valencia water"") cocktail builds on the sparkling wine recipe. It is popular in Valencia, Spain and the drink celebrates the areas oranges as well as cava, Spain\'s famous sparkling wine. The recipe is given to Constante Gil of the Caf? Madrid de Valencia in 1959. It\'s made by the pitcher: Combine 2 parts each fresh Valencia orange juice and cava with 1 part each gin and vodka. The ratio varies with different recipes and some are sweetened with a little sugar to taste. Another popular combination is 1 cup of orange juice, 2 ounces each of vodka and gin, and a full bottle of cava.\nHow Strong Is a Valencia Cocktail?\nIn general, all variations of this cocktail will be pretty mild drinks. For instance, if you make the Valencia cocktail with Marie Brizard Apry, a 42 proof liqueur, the drink will shake up to 12 percent ABV (24 proof).

It may not be quite as traditional as the sherry and brandy mix, but it is still an old recipe that's quite delicious. It makes about 17 4-ounce servings.\nTo make it, pour 3 12-ounce bottles of lager, 5 ounces of simple syrup, 3 ounces of lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon each of grated nutmeg and ginger into a large saucepan.

Place slices of fruit (e.g., apple, lemon, orange) in a heat resistant punch bowl or wassail bowl. Pour the warm liquid into the prepared bowl and serve in punch cups.\nHow Strong Is Wassail?\nLooking at these two versions of wassail, you might expect that the one made with a full bottle of rum would be stronger than the two-bottle sherry recipe. However, both recipes have an average alcohol content of 17 percent ABV (34 proof). That is a little strong for a punch, but it's not too potent, either.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis cocktail deserves a great apple brandy. Be sure to choose carefully and read the labels. Many of today's apple brandies are made with sugar?technically making them liqueurs?and will be disappointing. Spend a little more money on a true apple brandy and you'll enjoy a spectacular star cocktail.\nAs was common at the time, this recipe uses gomme (gum) syrup to sweeten the drink. Most people today use standard simple syrup and one could argue that this accommodation for modern bartending has brought the drink down a bit. For a taste of the original, pour the gomme option.\nIn his writing, Kappeler also suggests using either Peychaud or Angostura Aromatic Bitters. Either makes a great cocktail, but Peychaud is preferred by most star cocktail enthusiasts.\nRecipe Variations\nIn a pinch, you can pour a standard brandy (made from grapes rather than apples) into this cocktail. If you want to give it a hint of apple flavor, a four-day infusion of apples is a good option. For a quick alternative, you can muddle a few slices of apple with your brandy then strain out the fruit before mixing the drink.\nThe chrysanthemum cocktail is very similar to the star cocktail. The difference is that it pours regular brandy and dry vermouth, then accents those with absinthe.\nWhen you're in the mood for citrus, mix up the Fabiola cocktail. The recipe simply requires brandy, dry vermouth, and orange liqueur. It's fabulous with a good apple brandy as well.\nThe Saratoga cocktail brings whiskey into the mix. Again, this one is great with apple brandy, though you could stick with the traditional choice of Cognac.\nHow Strong Is the Star Cocktail?\nLaird's Apple Brandy is a popular option for the star cocktail, so it's a good choice for estimating the strength of this drink. With that 100-proof spirit, you can expect this cocktail to be around 27 percent ABV (54 proof). This is right in line with similar cocktails, including the martini and Manhattan.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/star-cocktail-recipe-759460

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with any martini, use the best spirits you can get. This cocktail relies solely on the liquor and without any fruits or other ingredients, there is no masking the taste of a low-quality spirit. Pick up one of the popular brands of premium vodka or use the recipe as an excuse to explore new bottles of luxury vodkas that catch your eye at the liquor store.\nDry vermouth will go stale and lose its flavor after a period of time. If your bottle has been open longer than a couple of months, it's time to replace it with fresh vermouth.\nWiping the glass rim with the lemon peel adds a brilliant accent of flavor that will hit your lips with each sip and brighten up the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nCustomizing any martini to your taste is highly recommended. Add more vermouth and pour less vodka to make up for the increased volume if you prefer a drier martini.\nShake or stir the diamond martini to dilute it and thoroughly mix the flavors.\nAnother way to accent the drink is to add two or three dashes of bitters. Aromatic and orange bitters are popular choices for martinis. Since this one is so transparent, it's also a great use for different flavors like grapefruit, lavender, lemon, or peach.\nHow Strong Is a Diamond Martini?\nIt should come as no surprise that the diamond martini is a very strong drink. It lacks any dilution from mixing it with ice and uses a double shot of vodka, making it the strongest martini you'll find. With an 80-proof vodka, this cocktail is 78 proof (39 percent ABV), just a notch lighter than a straight shot of vodka""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/diamond-martini-recipe-759639

You\'ll find it best with premium brands and well-aged whiskies. Look for older expressions and the specialty bottlings many Canadian blenders produce; it\'s a great recipe to use when discovering a new-to-you whisky\'s full potential.\nMake sure that your orange liqueur matches the quality of the whisky. The most inexpensive bottles of orange liqueur can be very syrupy and artificially flavored, leaving a lot to be desired in simple recipes like this. Plus, you\'ll use orange liqueur all the time in your bar, so a small investment will improve all your drinks.\nLikewise, fresh lemon juice is the best option for great tasting drinks. You should be able to get about 1 3/4 ounces out of one whole lemon, which is enough for three Canadian cocktails.\nAdding a small amount of simple syrup may only be needed with some whisky-liqueur combinations. Use your judgment and follow your personal taste to decide whether or not to add it. Adjust the orange liqueur and lemon as needed, too.\nRecipe Variations\nThough it\'s typically served up, the Canadian cocktail is also nice on ice. For the most enjoyable sipping experience, use a single large ice ball or cube because it will melt more slowly and reduce dilution.\nMake this same recipe with other styles of whiskey if you like (it technically won\'t be ""Canadian,"" but just a ""whiskey cocktail""). A bold rye whiskey or really flavorful bourbon are great candidates for the sweet-sour enhancements.\nHow Strong Is a Canadian Cocktail?\nThe Canadian cocktail\'s alcohol content is going to depend on the strength of the whisky you choose. For example, if you pour an 80-proof Canadian whisky, it will weigh in around 24 percent ABV (48 proof). While it\'s not a light drink, it\'s also not as strong as the Manhattan.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/canadian-cocktail-recipe-759630

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with any hot cocktail, your drink will stay warmer longer if you warm up your glass. Simply pour hot water in it while making the cocoa or microwave a water-filled glass for about 10 seconds. Dump out the water before building your drink.\nAny hot chocolate recipe works wonderfully for the chocolate kiss recipe. Whether you enjoy a powdered cocoa mix or rich, melted chocolate, pour your favorite.\nSome peppermint schnapps has a really strong flavor, especially those that are 100-proof like Rumple Minze. If you're pouring one of those, consider backing off a little so the drink doesn't become too minty.\nWhen it comes to coffee liqueurs, Kahl?a is probably the first brand that comes to mind. However, there are many other great options to explore. A few suggestions are those from Firelit, Leopold Bros., St. George Spirits, and New Deal.\nThe easiest whipped cream to use when topping drinks is a canned version, such as Reddi Wip. If you want to get crafty and enjoy the freshest whipped cream, make your own. For this drink, it would be fun to add a little mint or vanilla extract into the cream for extra flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nChocolate cocktails are a great excuse to add all sorts of indulgent garnishes. Beyond the cream and chocolate, you might want to use mini marshmallows, drizzle a little chocolate or sprinkle cocoa powder on top, or hang a candy cane on the rim.\nFor a drink that is a little stronger, replace the coffee liqueur with an espresso-infused vodka like those from Three Olives or Van Gogh.\nIf you don't have coffee liqueur in stock, you can use some regular coffee instead. Instant coffee granules are one possibility, or you can pour a little fresh-brewed coffee or espresso for an extra kick.\nHow Strong Is a Chocolate Kiss?\nUnless you pour a 100-proof schnapps, the chocolate kiss is going to be a very mild cocktail. With the average 30-proof liqueurs, the drink's alcohol content is only 3 percent ABV (6 proof), give or take. That is less than most beer.\n\nIf you go with the stronger schnapps, you're still looking at just 10 percent ABV (20 proof), which is like drinking a glass of wine, only yummier.

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you like this cocktail, with a few adjustments you can make a Will Rogers cocktail. Simply shake 2 ounces gin with 1 ounce each dry vermouth and orange juice, and finish this classic recipe with 4 dashes of cura?ao.\nChoose Your Gin\nThough it's not as crucial as it is in the original martini, choosing a top-shelf gin will make a better Bronx cocktail. The orange juice will cover up some impurities, but the real beauty here is tasting how the fruit plays off the botanicals in both the gin and vermouth.\nWith each new gin you pour, you'll experience subtle differences in the flavor, so have fun exploring your options. London dry gins will be a full-forced botanical array while softer gins like Aviation or Hendricks will impart their own unique flavors. Don't rule out genever, Old Tom Gin, or Plymouth Gin, either. These old-school gins were used a lot back in the golden era of the bar, so they're a perfect match for this classic recipe.\nVermouth Matters\nBeyond the recommendation of choosing quality dry and sweet vermouth, it's also good to remember that it goes bad. If you make a few martinis here and there, you might not use up a bottle before the flavor begins to turn. This can make a big difference in the taste of your Bronx.\nGenerally, the shelf-life on a bottle of vermouth is three months and it should be refrigerated. To help you remember when you opened it, write the month and year on the label with a permanent marker before putting it away.\nFresh OJ\nSince the orange juice plays such a prominent role in the Bronx, consider fresh-squeezed orange juice for this recipe. The freshness it brings to the drink instantly upgrades the entire experience. You should be able to get enough juice for two or three drinks out of a single orange.\nIn the least, choose a high-quality juice from the store to match the quality of the other ingredients you selected.\nHow Strong Is the Bronx?\nThat orange juice also helps bring the alcohol content of the Bronx to a level that's lower than the average martini. This is good news if you're looking for a casual drink without the heavy buzz and why it's one of the best gin martinis for brunch. On average, the Bronx weighs in at just 18 percent ABV (36 proof), making it a little stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bronx-cocktail-recipe-759608

You can even blend them with the pineapple before adding the other ingredients.\nThis recipe can make one large drink or two short drinks if you'd like to share.\nWhenever possible, use fresh fruits for this cocktail.\nA single grapefruit can yield up to 5 or 6 ounces of juice, which is more than enough for a couple of cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you don't want to blend the blue bayou, it's a great mix to shake up as well. Muddle the pineapple in a cocktail shaker first, then fill it with ice and add the rest of the ingredients. Shake and strain into a chilled glass, serving it over ice if you like.\nUse 1 to 1 1/2 ounces of pineapple juice rather than the fruit.\nFlavored vodkas can add a new dimension to this drink.

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a maraschino cherry.

Among the best and easiest to find are Effen and Grey Goose (Cherry Noir), though it's also available from other brands, including a number of small craft distilleries.\nFreshly squeezed lemon juice is preferred in this recipe because many bottled options are sweetened. You can simply squeeze the juice of a large lemon wedge into the shaker. If it's too sweet for you on the first sip, add a little more.\nSince this cocktail focuses on the cherry, upgrade your garnish to real maraschino cherries. Those from companies like Luxardo are actually a beautiful black color, a perfect fit for the vodka.\nWhen the fruit is in season (typically spring), use a fresh cherry garnish. You can even preserve those for the future by making your own maraschinos.\nRecipe Variations\nThis drink is also great served on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass.\nYou can make it taller by topping it with ginger ale or another lightly flavored soda.\nIf you're going to use cherry vodka, it might be a little tarter than black cherry. In this case, add a little more grenadine to sweeten it up.\nA black cherry rum is also a great substitute for the vodka.\nHow Strong Is a Black Cherry Breeze?\nLike most fruity vodka martinis, the black cherry breeze is a pretty strong drink. That's easy to forget when you're enjoying the sweet taste, but this cocktail mixes up to 27 percent ABV (54 proof). One too many and you're looking at a drunken night and the potential for a nasty hangover in the morning.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-cherry-breezer-recipe-759595

Serve cold and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe is for a single, 3-ounce box of gelatin, which is the most common size. It will make about 16 1-ounce shots and you can multiply the recipe to make more or to fit bigger cups.\nFood coloring isn\'t necessary unless you want to enhance or change the color of your shots. Banana gelatin will create a yellow shot, and keep in mind that this base will affect the final color (e.g., adding blue food coloring will create green shots).\nSmall plastic shot cups are good molds to use because the drinker can just squeeze the shot out. If you\'re transporting the shots, be sure to get cups with lids.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch out the flavor of gelatin if you like; banana simply enhances the primary flavor. Lime gelatin would be a good neutral daiquiri base.\nYou can also add to your fruity daiquiri or switch it up entirely with different gelatin flavors. For instance, recreate a strawberry daiquiri by using strawberry gelatin and liqueur in this recipe. Mix and match the two ingredients as you see fit.\nRum is the base for daiquiris, but you can certainly break that ""rule"" for these jello shots if you like. Try it with vodka or tequila instead.\nHow Strong Is a Banana Daiquiri Jello Shot?\nMost jello shots are not too strong, but with the three liquors in this recipe, it does tend to be one of the stronger options. On average, the banana daiquiri jello shots will have an alcohol content around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/banana-daiquiri-jelly-shot-recipe-759605

Stir well.\nTop with whipped cream and grated chocolate or a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPreheat your mug to keep the drink warmer longer: Fill the mug with hot water and let it sit for a few minutes, then dump it out before making the drink. In the microwave, simply warm up the water-filled mug for about 10 seconds.\nThis recipe will work with your favorite hot chocolate recipe. Whether you prefer powdered cocoa or thick drinking chocolate, the peppermint schnapps is a great way to boost the flavor.\nIf you prefer to make a smaller cup of cocoa, cut back on how much schnapps you pour. A full two ounces can easily overpower the chocolate taste if you pour less than 6 ounces.\nFor the whipped cream, you can get as involved as you like. Making your own is fun and you can flavor it in interesting ways. Then again, canned whipped cream is very convenient and tastes pretty good, too.\nRecipe Variations\nAround the holidays, pick up some mini candy canes to use as a garnish. Hang one on the side of the glass and allow it to melt in the warmth for an even mintier touch.\nNo peppermint schnapps in stock? If you have cr?me de menthe?either white or green?pour it instead. You'll actually be making a drink similar to the midnight snowstorm recipe.\nIf you really want to play up both flavors, mix up a hot peppermint patty. The recipe uses both peppermint schnapps and cr?me de menthe, along with cr?me de cacao.\nAdd a hint of coffee flavor to give the adult hot chocolate more dimension. Simply add a small shot of coffee liqueur as seen in the chocolate kiss recipe.\nFor a nonalcoholic alternative, skip the schnapps and stir about 1/2 teaspoon of mint extract into your cocoa.\nWhat Can Make Hot Cocoa Mix Taste Better?\nWhile it is nice to mix up a steaming cup of old-fashioned hot chocolate, the reality is that powdered cocoa mixes are much faster and easier, especially for simple cocktails like this. Instant cocoa mixes can be inexpensive and the quality does vary. If you enjoy the convenience of powdered cocoa, it's worth your time to explore different brands or make your own cocoa mix at home. No matter which you choose, there are a couple of things you can do to make any cocoa taste better:\nSlow down the pour: Try pouring just one-third of the hot liquid, give it a thorough stir, then slowly fill the cup while you continue to stir. This can help dissolve the dry mix and create smoother cocoa.\nMany cocoa mixes work better with warm milk instead of hot water, especially those that don't include a dry creamer. Heat the milk very slowly on the stovetop, stirring constantly, and never let it come to a boil in order to avoid scalding and curdling it. In the microwave, stir it every 15 seconds on medium-high power. With either method, warm the milk just until it begins to steam.\nHow Strong Is an Adult Hot Chocolate?\nPeppermint schnapps varies greatly in strength?from 30 to 100 proof. Which you pour will determine the strength of this cocktail. When made with a 30-proof schnapps, the recipe comes out to an extremely mild 3 percent ABV (6 proof), which is lighter than most beers. Its alcohol content with a 100-proof schnapps jumps up to 12 percent ABV (24 proof). Even that is equivalent to drinking a glass of wine, so go ahead and indulge!\n20 Heavenly Hot Chocolate Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/adult-hot-chocolate-recipe-759570

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nOne of the best recommendations is to chill the finished drink for 30 minutes. Not only will it help it keep its shape, but it also makes the drink nice and cold, which is good because there is no ice involved in making it. That's also a nice idea if you want to serve it with or as dessert; make the drinks before sitting down for dinner and they'll be ready for the final course!\nSome angel's tip recipes call for white cr?me de cacao while others prefer the dark version of the liqueur. Use whichever you like. The taste will not change, just the color of the bottom layer.\nMaraschino is also a clear liqueur, so using it with white cr?me de cacao will create a two-layer drink.\nMost cherry liqueurs should float nicely on top of the cr?me de cacao. They tend to have a lighter specific gravity than the sugar-laden chocolate liqueur. While using a substitute for maraschino shouldn't affect the layers, many alternatives are red and will add an extra layer of color.\nUnless you use thick whipped cream, don't expect the cherry to float on top of half-and-half. Either drop it in the glass or cut a slit in the cherry and rest it on the rim.\nRecipe Variations\nSome recipes skip either the maraschino or cr?me de cacao altogether. Try it with either liqueur alone if you like.\nYou can also use whipped cream and a few recipes prefer heavy cream rather than half-and-half. Use any type of cream you have in stock?you may also want to whip the cream up a little bit with a whisk. If you're using a canned whipped cream, be careful no not to disturb the drink underneath as it squirts out (typically an issue near the end of the can).\nIf you skip the cherry on top, you have a drink called King Alphonse.\nHow Strong Is an Angel's Tip?\nThis cocktail is relatively light on the alcohol. When made according to the recipe, it will weigh in at just 17 percent ABV (34 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/angels-tit-cocktail-recipe-759575

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with the cherry. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with any martini, your best abbey cocktail will use premium gin as a base.\nSome drinkers prefer a very botanical-heavy gin like the London dry style while others prefer something softer so the botanicals don't fight the orange juice. Explore all of the gin options to see which you like best. Don't forget about Plymouth Gin or genever, both of which were very common in classic drinks.\nLillet Blanc is a fortified wine that's famously called for in James Bond's Vesper martini. Similar to dry vermouth, it has a sweet orange note that's ideal for this cocktail.\nSince this drink relies on the orange juice, fresh is best. The average orange yields 2 to 3 ounces of juice, so squeezing one fruit will be enough for a few cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nCocchi Americano is a perfect substitute for Lillet Blanc and actually has a bitterness that was lost in Lillet's current recipe. The original abbey cocktail called for Kina Lillet, which included quinine (responsible for the dry bitterness of tonic water). For a seemingly more authentic taste, then, Cocchi is the better choice.\nIn a pinch, dry vermouth will do just fine as a Lillet substitute.\nOne version of the abbey cocktail is a little simpler, but it's equally fantastic. To make this drink, shake 2 ounces of gin, 1 1/2 ounces of orange juice, and two dashes of orange bitters.\nIf you pour gin, orange juice, and sweet vermouth in equal amounts, you have a wonderful 1930s cocktail called the orange blossom. That recipe is also sometimes called an abbey cocktail.\nHow Strong Is an Abbey Cocktail?\nThe abbey cocktail falls within a range that's typical of martinis made with fruit juice. When made with the average 80-proof gin, its alcohol content is 20 percent ABV (40 proof) or so. That's not a light drink and twice as potent as a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/abbey-cocktail-recipe-759566

Pineapple juice gets foamy when shaken and some people don't enjoy this aspect. However, it does settle after a few minutes.\nThankfully, rye whiskey has come back into fashion after a few decades of low production and visibility. There are now a number of great brands to choose from, and any of these would work wonderfully for this cocktail.\nUnsweetened pineapple juice is generally recommended by traditionalists who appreciate this cocktail with a drier profile.\nTo ensure the cleanest pineapple taste, run the fruit through an electric juicer or mash a few chunks of pineapple with a muddler before adding the other ingredients.\nRecipe Variations\nGive the drink a nice accent by adding a few dashes of orange bitters. You can also squeeze an orange peel into the drink to express its oils.\nSome modern interpretations of this recipe prefer it a little sweeter and use a pineapple gomme syrup. In these variations, the pour is often reduced to 1/2 ounce to maintain the drink's balance.\nOther sweetened versions keep the pineapple juice and add a dash of honey syrup (equal parts honey and water mixed to an even consistency).\nHow Strong Is an Algonquin Cocktail?\nThanks to the pineapple juice, this cocktail is a little lighter than whiskey favorites such as the Manhattan. When made with an 80 proof rye whiskey, you can expect its alcohol content to fall in the 20 percent ABV (40 proof) range. That's half the strength of the whiskey when served straight, so a couple of rounds will add up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/algonquin-cocktail-recipe-759574

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nBrew the most flavorful cup of coffee you can. If you typically use a drip coffee maker, consider using another style of brewer like a French press or pour-over brewer to produce a richer brew for all of your hot coffee cocktails and you'll see a big improvement.\nAnother way to improve your coffee is to start with whole beans and grind them yourself. There are subtle flavors that are lost with time after grinding and you can capture those by grinding only what you need at the moment.\nHeating your coffee glass or mug helps keep the drink warmer to the last sip. You can fill it with hot water while brewing the coffee. The alternative is to fill the glass with water and microwave it for about 10 seconds.\nYou can lightly whip cream and float it on top of the drink, just like the traditional Irish coffee. While that is amazing, the easy alternative is to simply use canned whipped cream.\nRecipe Variations\nThere is no really good substitute for Strega because it is a proprietary recipe. However, many people compare the liqueur to Yellow Chartreuse and that might be a good alternative in this recipe.\nAdd a shot of Strega to espresso if you like. To increase the volume and balance out the flavors, turn your double shot of espresso into a caff? Americano by adding an equal amount of hot water, then add the Strega.\nRather than ground nutmeg, dust the cream with ground cinnamon or simply add a cinnamon stick (it doubles as a stir stick, too).\nHow Strong Is an Italian Coffee?\nStrega is an 80-proof liqueur, so it's equivalent to the average rum, vodka, and similar distilled spirits. However, at just 1-ounce in this recipe, that doesn't make a big difference. The Italian coffee is a gently spiked drink with an alcohol content around 7 percent ABV (14 proof).

The taste will remain the same, but the cocktail will be brown rather than clear.\nFor the orange liqueur, pour your favorite. Cointreau, Grand Marnier, and any premium orange cura?ao are all good choices.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to skip the melted chocolate rim, powdered cocoa is an easier option that gives you the same chocolate taste with each sip. For this, mix equal parts of sugar and cocoa in a small dish. Wet the rim by dipping it in a dish of the orange liqueur (wiping an orange wedge around the rim works, too), then roll the rim in the cocoa-sugar mix.\nDouble up on the chocolate by pouring a chocolate vodka. You could also highlight the orange with citrus vodka.\nHow Strong Is a Chocolate and Orange Martini?\nAs with most martinis, this is not a light drink. That shouldn't come as much of a surprise, though, since the recipe contains nothing but liquor.

If you stick with the 1/2-ounce pour of Patron XO Cafe, it mixes up to just 2 percent ABV (4 proof). That's almost half the average beer.\nRecipe Variations\nAdd an extra kick to your caf? royal with a shot of tequila. The slight aging of reposado tequilas is a great addition to this drink and will give it an extra dimension of flavor.\nThe caf? royal is a great candidate for an iced coffee cocktail. For this version, consider making cold brew coffee. It's filled with the natural flavor of coffee beans and a great base for chilled drinks. This method takes at least 6 hours to brew, so you'll need to plan ahead.\nThere is also a popular coffee cocktail that goes by the name caf? royale.

Feel free to add more cassis if your wine is particularly dry and you really want to sweeten it up or use less for just a hint of sweetness. You may want to make adjustments for different wines.\nThe cardinal cocktail is typically not stirred, so the cassis sweetens the drink from the bottom up, much like the grenadine in a tequila sunrise. If you prefer, give it a quick stir.\nRecipe Variations\nTo give the cardinal cocktail a little sparkle, add a splash of club soda. This is a really nice option for creating a red wine spritzer and is especially pleasant in the summer.\nThe cardinal cocktail is also a great drink for ros? wines, particularly those that are a little drier, which is common with French Proven?al ros?s and those made from red wine grapes. You could also use it for a sparkling ros?, creating a drink similar to the kir royale, which is made with Champagne.\nIf you don't have cr?me de cassis, try another red fruit liqueur. Pomegranate (e.g., Pama) and strawberry liqueurs would be nice substitutes. You could also try it with a black raspberry liqueur such as Chambord.\nFor a nonalcoholic mixer, grenadine is a good choice. The pomegranate-flavored syrup is an excellent sweetener for drinks like this and will create an even lighter drink than one made with liqueurs.\nYou can also take a hint from the bishop cocktail and add a little rum to the cardinal. Use the cassis rather than simple syrup and pour a small shot of rum, accenting it with lime if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Cardinal Cocktail?\nGenerally, cr?me de cassis is bottled at 15 percent ABV (30 proof) and the average red wine is just 12 percent ABV. Combining the two creates a perfectly casual, low-proof cocktail. When poured according to the recipe, the cardinal cocktail should be right around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cardinal-cocktail-recipe-759615

Serve and enjoy.\nWho Invented the Bahama Mama?\nThe one accepted truth is that the Bahama mama was created in the Bahamas. Exactly when and by whom is not entirely clear. Some accounts claim that it was popularized in the 1950s. In his book, ""One More Cocktail,"" Oswald ""Slade"" Greenslade claims to have created the coffee-coconut version in 1961 while bartending at the Nassau Beach Hotel. He named it after a local Calypso dancer. It\'s most likely that a few drinks that took the name were developed on the islands almost simultaneously. As the drink gained fame, it spread beyond the Caribbean beaches and became a staple on the cocktail menus of American restaurant chains. In these venues, it was often mixed much sweeter than the original recipes intended.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than a coconut liqueur, you can use a coconut-flavored rum. Some rums, including Malibu, are actually both: coconut rum liqueurs.\nGrenadine can be added to any Bahama mama to create a sweeter, red cocktail.\nOne popular variation adds orange juice: Shake 1 ounce coconut rum, 1/2 ounce each dark rum, coffee liqueur, and grenadine, and 2 ounces each pineapple and orange juice with ice. Strain into a hurricane glass filled with cracked ice and garnish with an orange wedge and strawberries.\nA banana liqueur is a common ingredient, particularly in Bahama mama recipes that skip the coffee.\nThe Bahama mama also makes a great frozen cocktail. Simply add all of the ingredients to a blender with 1 cup of ice and blend until smooth.\nHow Strong Is the Bahama Mama?\nThere are many options when it comes to the spirits you pour into the Bahama mama, so it\'s hard to give a precise estimate of the drink\'s strength. Taking the average for the liquors, the Bahama mama typically falls into the 11 percent ABV (22 proof) range. It\'s similar to drinking a glass of wine though it can be easy to have one too many, especially if you enjoy a few rounds in the hot summer sun.

When in doubt, replace your vermouth with a new bottle.\nFresh lime juice is essential in the April rain. You will have a much better tasting cocktail if you avoid bottled juices. The average lime yields about 1 ounce of juice, so you can even simply squeeze half a lime into the shaker.\nServing your April rain in a chilled cocktail glass will complete the drink's wonderful experience. If you don't have one pre-chilled, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you shake up the drink, then dump them prior to straining.\nRecipe Variations\nRetain the dry profile, but give this cocktail a little sparkle by adding a splash of tonic water.\nYou can even transform it into a taller drink that's just as refreshing by serving it over ice in a collins glass, then topping it with tonic. That variation on the vodka tonic should last an entire meal.\nMake this drink with gin if you like. It will be like a gimlet with a vermouth twist and is an excellent alternative.\nHow Strong Is an April Rain Cocktail?\nThe April rain is one of those deceptive martini cocktails; it looks stunning but is rather strong at the same time. When made with an 80-proof vodka, you can expect its alcohol content to fall somewhere around 25 percent ABV (50 proof). That's normal for cocktails of this style and similar to the cosmopolitan.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/april-rain-cocktail-recipe-759580

It's a fun bartending technique that puts on a bit of a show but requires some practice to pull off without spilling.\nPassion fruit juice is not the most common type of juice. You can typically find it from brands like Maguary and Goya, either online or with natural or international foods at a grocer. It's also sometimes available as a frozen concentrate or you can juice fresh passion fruit.\nIf you're going to use frozen raspberries, thaw the berries first so they're easier to muddle.\nRecipe Variations\nMake the drink a little more refreshing by cutting the passion fruit juice in half and making up the volume with a light soda (e.g., club soda, ginger ale).\nA very similar drink to this, you can also mix up a raspberry mojito. The only differences are that the mojito uses rum and adds mint and ginger ale, skipping the passion fruit. Agavero would be rather nice in that recipe as a rum substitute.\nHow Strong Is a B?same?\nThis cocktail is filled with flavor but is delightfully light on the alcohol. Agavero's bottled at 64 proof and the drink mixes up to just 16 proof (8 percent ABV).

You need to be careful when doing this so you don't spill. Make sure the second vessel is a secure fit for your glass and hold both pieces securely without tilting them. Shake it in an up and down motion once or twice.\nIf you prefer, shake the drink in your cocktail shaker as normal or build the drink over ice in the serving glass and stir it very well to froth up the milk.\nFor the banana liqueur, you have a few options. Look for cr?me de banane, banana schnapps, or other liqueurs like 99 Bananas.\nIt's perfectly fine to use dark cr?me de cacao or another chocolate liqueur. The brown color will alter the drink's appearance slightly so it won't have the yellow hue, but it will taste the same.\nThe choice of dairy product is going to be a matter of personal preference. Milk will create a lighter cocktail and cream a significantly heavier one. You can also take the middle ground and pour half-and-half.\nYou can also use dairy alternatives, such as soy or almond milk if you prefer.\nRecipe Variations\nServe the banshee up in a cocktail glass if you like. Since you won't add ice, be sure to chill the glass and shake the drink, straining out the ice.\nAdd a banana split-like twist with a drizzle of strawberry syrup.\nIf you like the banshee, try the RumChata banana cream pie. It's a very similar recipe that combines the cream liqueur with banana liqueur. You can even use RumChata in the banshee in place of the cream.\nHow Strong Is a Banshee?\nEven with the strongest options for both liqueurs, the banshee is a light cocktail. It should weigh in at just 9 percent ABV (18 proof), but this can also vary depending on how much milk or cream you pour.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/banshee-cocktail-recipe-759585

The flavored brandy doesn't make a regular appearance in many bars today, so if you have a liqueur with the same flavor, you can pour that instead. Cherry Heering and a maraschino are the two most common options. They may not float as well, but they will give you the same flavor.\nPour a flavored vodka, but choose wisely. For a cocktail like this, finding a complementary flavored vodka can be tricky. One of the best choices is a vanilla vodka, though any of your dessert vodkas, such as whipped cream, would be tasty as well. Cherry vodkas can amplify that flavor, but be careful when you're buying these. Some of the cheaper bottles taste a lot like cough syrup.\nMake it creamy with a different chocolate liqueur. Dark cr?me de cacao is not a creamy liqueur, but it is sweet and has a great chocolate flavor. If you have a bottle of Godiva or a similar creamy chocolate liqueur, it can work in the Easter bunny though you will be changing the mouthfeel of the drink.\nHow Strong Is the Easter Bunny Cocktail?\nThis Easter bunny is not as sweet and innocent as it looks or tastes. You'll notice that it's made mostly of liquor, though the chocolate liqueur is the largest pour. That does help bring the drink's strength down a bit because cr?me de cacao tends to be bottled at 40 proof.\n\nWith that, you can expect your Easter bunny to mix up in the 20 percent ABV (40 proof) range, or about double a glass of wine.

Serve and enjoy.\nTip: To keep your apple garnish looking great and prevent it from turning brown, give it a quick dunk in lemon juice right after you cut it. \nHomemade Toffee Syrup\nThe toffee syrup used in this cocktail is very easy to make at home. This recipe relies on toffee candy (without nuts or any other additives) and simply dissolves it into hot water. It should take only 15 or 20 minutes to prepare and can be stored for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator. \nThis recipe will make just over 1 cup of syrup and give you plenty for multiple rounds of drinks. You can increase it if you like and the syrup can be used to flavor other drinks. It's a delicious addition to your morning coffee.\nIn a saucepan, combine about 3/4 cup of toffee candies and 1 cup of warm water.\nApply a gentle heat and stir constantly until the toffee is dissolved.\nAllow the syrup to cool before pouring into a jar with a tight seal. If solid bits of toffee remain, strain them out using a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth before bottling.\nAll toffee candy is different, and store-bought toffee may be sweeter than your homemade toffee, or vice versa. While the toffee typically makes the syrup sweet enough, you can add about 1/2 cup sugar if you like. \nTaste the syrup after the toffee dissolves and add sugar if you think it's needed. Stir the syrup after adding sugar, bring it to a slow boil, and simmer for about 5 minutes before testing it again. Keep in mind that the longer a syrup is on heat, the thicker it will become. It probably won't thicken until it cools, so it can sneak up on you. Go slow and gentle on the heat.\nMore Toffee and Caramel Options\nThat recipe is a very basic method for making a syrup with a sweet caramel flavor. It is not your only option, though. If you want to make the toffee apple cocktail and don't want a DIY project, many brands of syrup offer a caramel flavor. Torani and Amoretti are two good choices and they're readily available at grocers.\nAnother option is to make a caramel sauce. This tends to be thicker than a syrup, but you can always stir in a little water to make it thinner and easier to mix into cocktails.\nYou can also use the thinning trick to make caramel or butterscotch toppings that you'd use for ice cream work. Just be sure to add water in small amounts (a tablespoon at a time) and stir it thoroughly before deciding if it's the right consistency.\nOf course, if you're in a pinch and just happen to have butterscotch schnapps in the bar, it will make a fine substitute for the toffee syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Toffee Apple?\nSince the citrus vodka is the only liquor in this cocktail, it's significantly lighter than most apple martinis. If you stick with Belvedere?which is 80-proof rather than the 70-proof typical of flavored vodkas?the drink weighs in around 12 percent ABV (24 proof). That's about the same as a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/belvedere-toffee-apple-recipe-760937

Double the recipe and serve it in a chilled cocktail glass or over ice in an old-fashioned glass.\nHow Strong Is a Berry Whipped Shot?\nEven though this shot doubles up on the vodka, they're each only bottled at 70 proof (80 proof is standard for vodka).

The exceptions are Hiram Walker Pumpkin Spice and Bols Pumpkin Spice; both have been reliable in the past.\nSearch your local stores to see what brands are available in any particular year. If you find one you really like, stock up. Remember that liqueurs have sugar that decreases the shelf life. You may get a second year out of an unopened bottle, but don't count on it.\nLook for a mid-shelf vanilla vodka from your favorite brand. Absolut Vanilia Vodka is always a good choice.\nRumChata can typically be found at most well-appointed liquor stores. Bailey's also makes a vanilla and cinnamon version of their cream liqueur that makes a good substitute.\nTo batch this cocktail, multiply the ingredient amounts by the number of serving and mix in a pitcher. Chill in the fridge for up to several hours, mix again, and serve.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than pumpkin liqueur, use pumpkin spice syrup?a key ingredient for pumpkin spice lattes. In the grocery store, it's usually with the coffee sweeteners.\nYou can also use three tablespoons of pumpkin pie filling for this martini instead of the liqueur. Shake for 30 seconds to fully mix the thick pur?e.\nHow Strong Is a Pumpkin Pie Martini?\nThe pumpkin pie martini is both delicious and delightfully light on the alcohol. With a pumpkin liqueur, it has an alcohol content of just 11 percent ABV (22 proof). If you opt for one of the nonalcoholic pumpkin mixers, it's even lower than that.\nIs a Pumpkin Pie Martini a Good Pairing for Pumpkin Pie?\nThe general rule for food and cocktail pairings is to avoid matching flavors. Under that theory, a pumpkin martini is not a great match for pumpkin pie. However, this particular cocktail is more cream than pumpkin. When made with pumpkin spice liqueur or syrup, it could be a delicious complement to a piece of pumpkin pie. The martini would also be excellent with cheesecake or a chocolate dessert.\n\nOther good drinks for pumpkin pie include a chocolate martini, whiskey Manhattan, cinnamon coffee, and spiced seasonal beers.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo make this cocktail even prettier, try a cinnamon sugar rim. Simply mix 1 part ground cinnamon with 2 parts sugar until it becomes a uniform brown. Place this in a tray or flat dish. Wet the rim of a glass with a lime or a touch of half-and-half and roll the rim around in the sugar to get an even coat. Shake off any excess in the sink or over the garbage.\nAnother fun rimming option is to use finely crushed graham crackers to give it more of a pumpkin pie feel. Mix this in with cinnamon and sugar if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Spiced Pumpkin Cocktail?\nPinnacle Pumpkin Pie is bottled at a relatively mild 70 proof. It and the Irish cream make up most of this cocktail, so it's as strong as any the majority of liquor-only martinis. The alcohol content should fall in the 25 percent ABV (50 proof) range. Keep in mind that the sweet taste can mask all that alcohol, so go slow.\nFinding the Pumpkin Vodka\nAny pumpkin drink lover who gets an autumnal craving for the flavor knows that finding pumpkin-flavored liquor can be a challenge. The good news is that Pinnacle's vodka is one of the most reliable on the market. Since its release in 2012, it has made a regular appearance each autumn and many liquor stores choose to stock it through the December holidays.\nGranted, that might change in the future. This is an extremely seasonal flavor and because of that, many companies won't invest the time and money into it. There is also the possibility that you'll come across another pumpkin vodka from time to time. When you discover a new one, give it a try. Just don't hold your breath that you'll find it again next year!\nMake Your Own Pumpkin Vodka\nWhen a search at the liquor store fails, consider making your own pumpkin vodka. The pumpkin infusion used in Belvedere Vodka's spiced pumpkin martini is a great place to begin and can be done in just one day. It doesn't have the sweet pie-like flavor of Pinnacle's, but that can be fixed.\nTo sweeten a DIY pumpkin vodka, take the homemade liqueur approach. This amaretto recipe, for instance, uses a brown sugar syrup that would be a fantastic base for pumpkin. It's incredibly easy to make and adds just one more step to the infusion.\nAdd the syrup while blending the pumpkin water with the vodka, sweetening it to taste.

Stir it well to ensure the flavors are fully mixed and become one.\nSloe gin is a liqueur and not a true gin (though it's sometimes used as the base liquor). Flavored with sloes, the fruit of a blackthorn bush, many of the sloe gins you find at the liquor store are extraordinarily sweet and can easily overpower this drink. If you have one of these, pour only 1/2 ounce of sloe gin and make up the difference with orange juice.\nRather than pick up the cheapest bottle of sloe gin, spend a little more money and you'll improve all your sloe gin drinks. Plymouth Sloe Gin and Monkey 47 Sloe Gin are great options.\nRecipe Variations\nOne Alabama Slammer recipe uses a dash of grenadine rather than sloe gin and as much as 4 ounces of orange juice. The Southern Comfort and amaretto remain at 1-ounce pours.\nOther recipes use both grenadine and sloe gin, which will create a very sweet drink and may require more orange juice.\nMany variations on the Alabama Slammer add an extra kick with either vodka or bourbon, or both. Some add a 1-ounce shot of one of those liquors while other recipes skip the amaretto and pour 1 ounce of both liquors, then knock the sloe gin back to 3/4 ounce.\nAt Gallettes Tuscaloosa, a bar near the Alabama football stadium where thousands of these drinks are served on game day, it's known as a yellow hammer. It mixes equal parts of vodka, light rum, and amaretto with orange and pineapple juices.\nHow Strong Is an Alabama Slammer?\nSoCo is available at various strengths, from 42 proof up to 100 proof. Assuming you pour the strongest version, the Alabama Slammer will have an alcohol content of 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

There's a strong possibility that you'll be left with a chunk or two of the paste, which is why dissolving it into the vodka is recommended.\nThe consistency and texture of wasabi vary a bit as well. You might find that with some prepackaged wasabis, double straining through a fine mesh strainer is not necessary. Then again, if you choose a chunkier, freshly prepared wasabi?the truest flavor option?it may need to be strained a few times to get a clean cocktail.\nFor a garnish, give your cocktail a green highlight with a simple lime peel. Hanging a spiral on the rim is a beautiful touch that really adds to the drink's allure.\nA thin ribbon of cucumber gently folded inside the glass is nice as well. With this, you'll find that the cool flavor is a great contrast to the spicy cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to add another background flavor, pour a cucumber- or ginger-infused vodka. Either infusion can be made at home very easily and there are a few commercial versions available, too. With the ginger, you'll be adding to the drink's spice while the cucumber cools down the palate just enough to make a drink anyone will enjoy.\nAnother option is to replace the vodka with sake. It's a natural pairing for wasabi, given the ingredients' origins in the culinary world, and brings in a subtle but intriguing twist.\nThe cucumber wasabi martini plays up the fascinating combination of its two named ingredients. The recipe is very similar to this one, but it opts for gin and muddles a few cucumber slices with the wasabi and syrup.\nHow Strong Is a Wasabi Martini?\nThe wasabi martini packs a punch, both in its flavor and the alcohol. It will shake up to 22 percent ABV (44 proof) or so, which is typical of martinis.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/wasabi-martini-recipe-760984

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe mixes up to be about 7 1/2 ounces, which is double the average martini. If you don't have a glass that size, either divide the drink into two glasses and share or cut all of the ingredients in half to make one drink.\nA heaping garnish of whipped cream may be a little much for some. If you prefer, begin with a small dollop or forgo it altogether.\nA homemade sour mix will create a better-tasting drink, and it's easy to make. Essentially, you'll add equal parts lemon and lime juice (or either citrus) to simple syrup.\nRecipe Variations\nServe this cocktail over ice in a collins or highball glass, just like the tequila sunrise. The recipe's volume is perfect for a single tall glass.\nSkip the sweet vodka and pour tequila instead. You can keep the whipped cream garnish and still get a sweeter martini-style drink.\nFor a similar drink that reverts to the sunrise's original orange juice, try whipped cream vodka in the sour sunrise recipe, using it as a substitute for the bourbon.\nHow Strong Is a Whipped Sunrise?\nWhipped vodkas are low-proof and often bottled at 60 proof. Since a single shot of that is the only liquor in the drink, it's extremely light and will shake up to just 6 percent ABV (12 proof). It's like drinking a strong beer, only far more delicious.\nDoes Whipped Vodka Include Sugar?\nWhile some flavored vodkas do not include sugar, whipped vodka (or whipped cream vodka) will almost always contain sugar. The sweetener is how vodka makers replicate the sweet taste of whipped cream. The amount of sugar varies by brand, and you should expect that any dessert-flavored vodka includes more sugar than all other flavored vodkas. If you're trying to control your sugar intake, switch to an unflavored 80-proof vodka, as these should be sugar-free.\n17 Dessert Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whipped-sunset-recipe-760985

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon peel. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nCr?me de cacao really is the best chocolate liqueur choice for this particular recipe. Most other options are creamy, which is not ideal with lemonade.\nIf all you have in stock is dark cr?me de cacao, use it. The taste won't change, but the cocktail will have a brownish color.\nThis drink is much better with homemade lemonade. You don't need to make a whole batch either. Simply pour 1 part each fresh lemon juice and simple syrup with 2 parts water, shaking it with ice in your cocktail shaker. With that formula, you can make as little or as much as you like and can customize the sweet and sour flavors to perfectly suit your taste.\nServing this drink in a chilled glass will keep it cooler longer and make your entire drinking experience a little more pleasant. Since cocktail glasses are awkward in the freezer, especially if you're limited on space, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're mixing for a quick chill.\nRecipe Variation\nGive this drink a little sparkle by topping it with a sparkling ros?. The blush pink wine often has hints of strawberry and watermelon, which would be fabulous accents for the martini's flavors.\nHow Strong Is a Berried Treasure Cocktail?\nThe berried treasure is lighter than most fruity vodka martinis. It helps that the vodka is 70 proof and the low-proof liqueur is diluted with lemonade. With those factors in mind, this drink's alcohol content is just 18 percent ABV (36 proof). That's just a little stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-berried-treasure-recipe-760981

By doing this, you integrate the spices within the cocktail base while dressing up the drink perfectly. Adjust the spice uses and amounts to fit your tastes.\nBecause this drink is not served over ice, it's best to chill your glass thoroughly before straining the drink. If you forget to put your glass in the freezer, simply place a couple of ice cubes in it while you're mixing, then dump them out.\nCoconut cream is not as sweet as cream of coconut, which is typically used in mixed drinks. If you are trying to cut sugar or want a more natural (unprocessed) ingredient, coconut cream is the better option. It is rich, has a buttery feel, and a great coconut flavor and it's relatively easy to make yourself.\nAdding the egg white gives the drink a lovely foam and adds to its creaminess. It does not create a really eggy flavor like eggnog (that comes mostly from the yolk).\nThe key to safely drinking eggs is to ensure your egg is fresh. Do a quick water test by placing the egg in a glass of water; if it sinks, it's fresh.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you skip the spices, this recipe is a fantastic vodka pi?a colada that will work any day of the year.\nSome people do not like the thought of drinking raw egg, so skip it if you like. The milk and cream will still give the holiday spice a nice creaminess.\nHow Strong Is a Holiday Spice?\nLike many flavored vodkas, C?roc Coconut Vodka is bottled at just 70-proof, so it's a little lighter than the average vodka. With that and all the nonalcoholic ingredients, this cocktail is very mild. Its alcohol content should be around 11 percent ABV (22 proof), which is a lot like drinking a glass of wine, only far more delicious!\n20 Festive Christmas Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ciroc-holiday-spice-cocktail-recipe-760947

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFresh citrus juices definitely make a brighter, better tasting peach punch. You should be able to squeeze half a lime for the required 1/2 ounce. One orange yields 2 to 3 ounces, more than enough for a few drinks.\nFor the elderflower liqueur, St. Germain is probably the easiest to find and best-known brand. Bertina, Bols, Drillaud, and Fiorente are a few other brands that produce it as well.\nThe other option, if you have access to fresh elderflowers, is to make your own nonalcoholic elderflower cordial. It's a fun project that is ready within a couple of days because you'll have to let the flowers and lemons steep in the sugar water.\nHow Strong Is a Peach Punch?\nThis cocktail is actually more of a fruity vodka martini than a punch, particularly when it comes to the alcohol content. Even though New Amsterdam Peach is bottled at 70 proof rather than vodka's standard 80 proof, the drink still mixes up to a hefty 20 percent ABV (40 proof), equivalent to drinks like the cosmopolitan. It's a peachy drink that packs a real punch.\nRecipe Variations\nGenerally, transforming this recipe into a punch is very straight forward because all of the ingredients except the vodka are equal. You can simply increase each of them for the number of servings you need. However, it can be a little strong to serve unsuspecting guests (10 percent ABV is more of a comfortable range for party punches) unless you're going for a martini brunch. There are a few ways to knock the strength down while retaining a delicious, fruity taste.\nIncreasing the juices is the easiest option. Doubling up on the lime and orange juices so they collectively equal the vodka will help out.\nAnother option is to add a nonalcoholic peach ingredient to back up the vodka's flavor. Try splitting the vodka in half and making up the difference with peach nectar or juice.\nThe other super easy option is to transform the punch into a sparkling delight. Mix up the drink as is in a pitcher, then serve it in ice-filled tumblers, filling each with a lightly flavored soda (e.g., club soda, ginger ale, lemon-lime soda). A sparkling ros? or white wine are also good options that add volume and effervescence with minimal alcohol.\nThe soda or sparkling wine finishing touch also works for the single cocktail if you'd like to make the drink taller and more refreshing.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/peach-punch-recipe-760965

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with marshmallows and a sprinkle with cocoa powder. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nA creamy cocktail like this is better when served in a chilled glass and the frostier the better. If you don't have room to store a few glasses in the freezer or forget to pre-chill them, simply place a few ice cubes in each glass while you mix up the drink and dump them before straining.\nGodiva Dark Chocolate does not have a one-dimensional flavor. The taste of unsweetened dark chocolate is accented with black cherry, candied orange peel, and cold brew coffee. There are plenty of other chocolate liqueurs on the market, but few are as complex, which is why it works so well in this cocktail.\nThe cream will make a rather thick cocktail. You can lighten it up by using milk (2 percent is often best as skim can be too thin) or half and half as a substitute. Alternatives to dairy products like almond or soy milk work as well.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you are in the mood for a S'mores-like cocktail, use finely crushed graham crackers to rim the glass, using the liqueur as the wetting agent. Or, you could do a 1:1 mix of the crackers and cocoa on the rim.\nTransform this cocktail into a boozy milkshake by adding the ingredients to a blender with a scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream.\nThe dark 'n fluffy would be just as yummy with any of the confectionary vodkas on the market. Try it with a cake or whipped cream vodka if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Dark 'n Fluffy?\nThe majority of sweet vodkas are lower proof than clear vodkas and Smirnoff's marshmallow is no exception; it's bottled at 60 proof. Godiva is even lighter at 30-proof, so this is one of the lightest chocolate martinis you can mix up. At just 16 percent ABV (32 proof), it's only slightly stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/dark-n-fluffy-recipe-760951

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nGrey Goose doesn't define the flavor of bitters in the recipe. By default, you might choose aromatic bitters such as that from Angostura. However, this is a great opportunity to experiment with various options. Try the cherry lane with orange, chocolate, peach, lavender, or even celery bitters and add a few dashes if you like.\nFresh lemon juice and homemade simple syrup are recommended to produce the best cocktail. One full-sized lemon should produce just enough juice for one cocktail.\nThe cherry garnish really makes a big difference with this cocktail. If you can, use fresh cherries?the season lasts from May to August. Brandied cherries and high-end or homemade maraschino cherries are the next best option.\nTry to avoid those neon red maraschinos that are so common. They are artificially flavored and actually bleached before being dyed again. If that's your only option, it may be best to go without a garnish or switch to a lemon twist.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to make your own cherry vodka, it's easy and a nice project when the fruit is in season. The key to reducing any potential medicinal flavor is to use a super smooth vodka. The impurities in cheap vodkas will definitely show in this infusion.\nRather than Benedictine, you could use another herbal liqueur like Drambuie or Yellow Chartreuse. Neither will produce an identical drink, but they will mix well in the recipe.\nA honey liqueur like B?renj?ger or the sweet nutty taste of amaretto or Frangelico would be good Benedictine substitutes, too.\nHow Strong Is a Cherry Noir?\nUnlike many flavored vodkas, which are bottled at 70 proof, Grey Goose Cherry Noir is a full 80-proof vodka, as is Benedictine. While those would typically make the cherry lane stronger than the average vodka martini, the heavy pour of lemon juice brings it down significantly. It will shake up to around 14 percent ABV (28 proof), making it just slightly stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cherry-lane-cocktail-760955

They can be juiced just like any other citrus fruit.\nBottled blood orange juice is available, though it is not one of the most common commercial juices, so it can be difficult to find. Look for it with the natural and organic foods at grocers.\nDry's Blood Orange Soda is unlike any other orange soda you have probably had. This soda has a dark, semi-sweet citrus taste that is naturally flavored and light on the sugar, making it a perfect mixer for cocktails like this.\nA number of syrup makers, including BG Reynolds, DaVinci, Fabbri, and Torani offer cinnamon-flavored syrup.\nAlternatively, it's an incredibly easy syrup to make at home. For the cinnamon syrup, all you need is sugar, water, and a cinnamon stick. It's ready in about an hour and is a fantastic coffee and tea sweetener as well.\nRecipe Variations\nRegular orange juice can be used instead of blood orange, though it will be more acidic and not as sweet.\nPour a flavored vodka if you like. Good options include ginger, grapefruit, pomegranate, and vanilla.\nGin is an excellent base for collins drinks as well?the Tom Collins is one of the most popular recipes in this drink family, after all. It would make a great substitute for the vodka in this recipe.\nPouring whiskey is a good option, too. It will pair nicely with blood orange and cinnamon and give the drink a John Collins spin.\nHow Strong Is an Almost a Collins?\nJust like the majority of highball drinks, this recipe is very gentle, with an alcohol content falling right between beer and wine.

Wiping it around the rim of your glass adds a refreshing tartness that's really nice as well.\nRecipe Variations\nThe watermelon liqueur is a sweet one, so if you find that this recipe too sweet you can always cut back or eliminate the simple syrup.\nAnother way to reduce the sweetness is to switch from red to white cranberry juice. The lighter juice (it's actually similar in color to apple juice) offers a more refreshing taste while maintaining the cranberry flavor.\nTry this cocktail with a flavored vodka. Any citrus or berry vodka would be a nice complement to the other fruits.\nYou can also try cucumber vodka, as that flavor is an excellent match for watermelon. Effen, Prairie Organic, and Smirnoff are a few brands that offer nice cucumber vodkas.\nBuilding off that flavor duo, ramp up the taste of this cosmo in a similar manner to the watermelon cucumber recipe. To do this, muddle a fresh piece of watermelon and a couple of cucumber slices in the cocktail shaker before adding the ingredients. You'll want to fine strain the drink?pour through your regular cocktail strainer as well as a fine mesh strainer?to keep pieces of the fruits out of the glass.\nHow Strong Is a Watermelon Cosmo?\nAlmost half the strength of the original cosmo, using the 34 proof liqueur as the main ingredient definitely knocks down the alcohol content.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPumpkin liqueurs can be somewhat elusive and many brands don't stick around from one year to the next. Explore your local liquor store's offerings and pick up whatever you find. They typically start making an appearance in September and Bols and Hiram Walker tend to be reliable brands. You can also pour Pinnacle Pumpkin Pie Vodka.\nThe key to the cookie rim is to crush them as finely as possible. A blender or food processor will make quick work of it. You can also place them in a plastic zipper bag and roll over them with a rolling pin or smash the cookies with a muddler or hammer.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you can't find a bottle of Baileys Caramel, pour regular Irish cream instead. You can bring back that caramel flavor with a squirt of caramel syrup (either a coffee syrup or the type used as an ice cream topping).\nAs an alternative to the liqueur, use a pumpkin spice syrup instead. These are often the secret to quickly flavoring pumpkin spice lattes. You can typically find the syrup within the coffee sweeteners at grocery stores during the autumn season.\nHow Strong Is a Ghost-tini?\nThis martini may taste all sweet and innocent but it packs a big punch.

It's simply the best-known, but there are many great options that can actually save a little money.\nItaly's Prosecco is a fantastic choice that's known for vivacious bubbles and Spain's Cavas are excellent as well (both tend to be less expensive than French Champagne). This drink would also work very well with a sparkling ros?, which is known for hints of strawberry flavors that are lovely against raspberry and mango.\nMango nectar is relatively easy to find at grocers. It tends to be sold in 12-ounce cans and can be found with other nectars near the fruit juices.\nFor party service, you can certainly mix up a large batch of the vodka-nectar combination ahead of time. Store it in the refrigerator until needed. Always add the wine at the last minute so your guests can enjoy the full sparkle.\nRecipe Variations\nAs an alternative to the raspberry vodka, mix up the French sparkle with clear vodka and Chambord. For this adaptation, try 1 ounce of vodka, 1/2 ounce of Chambord, and 1 1/2 ounces of mango nectar.\nIf you skip the mango nectar, you will have a cocktail called Champagne and Chambord.\nHow Strong Is a French Sparkle?\nMost raspberry vodkas are bottled at 70 proof and sparkling wines tend to be around 13 percent ABV. Using those two numbers, the French sparkle mixes up to an alcohol content around 10 percent ABV (20 proof).

It\'s a perfect recipe for cheaper vodkas, some of which are surprisingly impressive for the price.\nRecipe Variations\nFlavored vodkas are a great option. Consider building on the red fruit flavor with berries or pomegranate. Espresso vodka and many of the dessert vodkas would be interesting here as well.\nAny cherry liqueur will work just fine in place of the brandy. Consider maraschino or Cherry Heering, or double up on the vodka and only pour a cherry-flavored vodka instead. You can even skip the alcohol and use cherry syrup or simply grab a bottle of grenadine (technically pomegranate flavored), similar to the Roy Rogers mocktail.\nThe easiest way to build up a different fruity flavor is to use a juice blend that includes cranberry. Pomegranate, other berries, apple, grape, and cherry are often added to cranberry juice and any of these blends would be great in the black cat. Simply explore the options available at the store and give one a try.\nGarnish Ideas\nThough the black cat recipe does not specify a garnish, it would be a nice addition for a party. The natural choice is a cherry. You could skip the bright red maraschinos and make your own using fresh cherries and maraschino liqueur. It\'s a fun and useful DIY project that creates cherries you\'ll actually want to eat.\nIf you\'re serving this cocktail for Halloween, let your imagination run wild on the garnish. The lychee eyeball is always a hit and would be fun floating on top of the ice.\nYou can also use a novelty ice tray with skulls, bones, and other creepy figures. To add a ""bloody"" effect, drizzle a little grenadine in the tray when the water\'s partially set up or add red fruit like cranberries to the ice.\nHow Strong Is a Black Cat?\nThis is one black cat you won\'t mind crossing your path! Beyond the appealing taste, it\'s also low-proof. When made with the average vodka and cherry brandy, it mixes up to just 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That\'s right in between beer and wine, so go ahead and have another!']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-cat-cocktail-recipe-761004

It is an unflavored vodka, though the catechu extract used to make it black does impart a slightly herbal finish.\nIt's incredibly easy to make your own black vodka using any vodka you choose. A few drops of blue, green, and red food coloring are all you need. It's not perfect, but it is a quick and inexpensive way to create this novelty ingredient.\nStir the drink after adding the soda if you prefer. Otherwise, serve it with a straw and stir as you go.\nWhen left unstirred, the grenadine will sink to the bottom?just like in a tequila sunrise?and produce a bloody base for your dark drink.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can certainly make this drink with any vodka you like.

No other vodka pairs the taste of raspberry with a bold blue color. Luckily, it happens to be one of the best affordable vodkas on the market, so it's also a good choice for the budget-conscious drinker.\nWhen choosing the chocolate liqueur, go with white cr?me de cacao. This is a clear, sweet liqueur that allows the vodka to control the martini's color. The dark variety of cacao is brown (as are most other chocolate liqueurs) and all of them will muddy up the look of the drink.\nYou do not need to buy the best triple sec at the liquor store, but try to avoid the cheapest bottles. In cocktails as simple and clean as this recipe, each ingredient plays an important role in the finished taste. Besides, orange liqueurs will be used all the time in your bar as you explore drink recipes, so it really is a good idea to keep quality and versatility in mind when selecting one.\nLime juice is just as important as the other ingredients. You'll find that the best chocolate raspberry martini is made with fresh-squeezed lime juice. Limes typically yield 1/2 to 1 ounce of juice per fruit, so one lime will take care of one or two drinks.\nIf you would like to add a garnish to this martini, a simple lime or orange twist would be an elegant touch. Cut the peel from the limes you're going to juice before slicing them open to get the most out of each fruit. To preserve a twist, place it in a glass of ice-cold water until it's time to serve the drink.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you prefer to use another raspberry vodka, switch from triple sec to blue cura?ao to retain the color.\nHow Strong Is a Chocolate Raspberry Martini?\nUV Blue is bottled at just 30 percent ABV (60 proof), so it's one of the lightest vodkas you will find. In theory, that would make this a pretty low-proof martini, but you have to keep in mind that two of the other three ingredients are nearly as strong as the vodka. With that, this cocktail's alcohol content should be somewhere around 20 percent ABV (40 proof), so you would need to drink two successively to equal a straight shot of the average vodka.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/berry-white-cocktail-recipe-761002

Then again, you may enjoy it with a super smooth brand.

Traditionally, crushed ice is preferred, though you can use ice cubes as well.\nThe zombie is always served in a tall glass. The ""zombie glass"" is a 12-ounce version of highball or collins glasses. If you\'re looking for a more tropical look and feel, serve it in a hurricane glass.\nTo float the rum, a bar spoon is handy. It has a thinner bowl that can fit into most glasses, and the long handle helps with balance for a smoother pour. A regular small spoon will work in a pinch.\nRecipe Variations\nIn the 1950 recipe from Berry\'s book, the original sweetener is 1 teaspoon brown sugar. It\'s dissolved in the lime juice before the other ingredients are added. While the recipe doesn\'t indicate straining, shaking breaks down the ice. It\'s generally best to strain the cocktail over fresh ice to avoid an overly diluted cocktail.\nDale Degroff\'s zombie recipe from ""The Craft of the Cocktail"" is a popular option. To make it, combine 1 ounce each of light rum, dark rum, and orange cura?ao with 1 1/2 ounces each of passion fruit pur?e or syrup and orange juice, 1/2 ounce each of fresh lemon and lime juices, 1/4 ounce of grenadine, and 2 dashes of aromatic bitters. Shake with ice and strain into a tall glass over fresh ice. Float 1/2 ounce of 151-proof dark rum on top (it can be added to the shaker or skipped entirely) and garnish with mint and seasonal fruits.\nTry Gary (""Gaz"") Regan\'s Zombie No. 2 from ""The Joy of Mixology,"" which he notes was adapted from Berry\'s ""Beachbum Berry\'s Grog Log"" (2003): Combine 1 ounce dark rum, 1 1/2 ounces each of a?ejo and light rums, 3/4 ounce each of applejack, papaya nectar, and pineapple juice, 1 ounce fresh lime juice, and 1/2 ounce simple syrup and shake with ice. Strain into a tall glass over fresh ice, then float 1/2 ounce of 151-proof rum on top. Garnish with a maraschino cherry, pineapple spear, and mint sprig.\nWho Created the Zombie Cocktail?\nDonn Beach (born Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt in 1907; died in 1989) is a legend among bartenders. He devised the first tropical-themed establishment that laid the foundation for America\'s tiki bar scene. Beach was not only a great businessman but also had a knack for combining an array of ingredients to create elaborate tropical cocktails, including the zombie.\n\nIt\'s likely that the zombie was one of Beach\'s first cocktails. In Spievak\'s book, he\'s quoted as saying, "" I originated and served this \'thing\' since 1934."" However, it\'s unclear what was in that first mix and whether it was the zombie or the zombie punch. Berry\'s ""Sippin\' Safari"" book explores all the possibilities in fascinating detail.\n\nWhile it\'s agreed today that Beach created the zombie, many others tried to take credit for it over the years. Monte Proser\'s Zombie was served during the 1939 World\'s Fair in New York, and quite a few other bars claimed to be ""home of the zombie."" Despite the controversies, lost stories, and variations, this famous cocktail was definitely good business.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between the Zombie and Zombie Punch?\nBerry\'s zombie research indicates that the original zombie may have actually been named the zombie punch. A 1930s Don the Beachcomber bartender\'s recipe card is similar to the zombie punch recipe that includes falernum, anise liquor, cinnamon syrup, and grenadine. This is also similar to a blended zombie found in a 1956 issue of the Cabaret Quarterly magazine from Beach\'s Waikiki location. Beach was fond of blended drinks, which is why this shaken zombie was likely a simplified variation of the original. Nonetheless, the array of fruit juices and other flavors place all zombie cocktails in the classic definition of a punch.\nHow Strong Is the Zombie Cocktail?\nThe zombie is a rum-filled, notoriously powerful drink. It\'s said that Beach limited each customer to two zombies due to the cocktail\'s potency. But how strong is it? The recipe you choose is going to make a difference, though they are comparable. For instance, the 1950 zombie shakes up to around 20 percent ABV (40 proof) when made with 80-proof light and gold rums. DeGroff\'s zombie falls in that range, but Regan\'s zombie is slightly heavier at 25 percent ABV (50 proof).\n25 Best Blended Cocktails to Enjoy This Summer']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/zombie-cocktail-recipe-761643

Look for it from Irish cream brands like Baileys, Merry's, and O'Donnells.\nMozart makes a delicious white chocolate strawberry cream liqueur. It could easily replace the recipe's tequila rose and chocolate liqueur in one pour.\nIf you pour a cream chocolate liqueur, think about replacing the half-and-half with milk to balance out the thickness of the drink. Skim milk will likely be too light, but a 2 percent milk should be about perfect. Another option is to cut the half-and-half to 1/2 ounce and double up on the rum.\nThere is a similar cocktail that you may enjoy as well. It's also pink, creamy, and delicious, but it has a pomegranate flavor accented with vanilla and herbs. The cocktail is called the red snapper and it's just one drink that goes by the name (a more popular one is a Crown Royal shooter).

Enjoy.\nRecipe Variation\nUse 1/4 teaspoon chile powder instead of hot sauce.\nThe Tomato-Based Sangrita\nThe Sangrita originated in Mexico, the home of tequila and it's meant to make the straight shot a little easier to get down. While the citrus-based recipe is considered the original Sangrita, the drink took a turn when it was popularized in the U.S.\nYou will notice that the second shot glass in this recipe is filled with a simplified Bloody Mary mix. It is a fantastic follow up to tequila and those few drops of hot sauce can really add a spicy kick to the drink.\nTo make the shot, shake 1 ounce tomato or clamato juice with 3 to 5 drops Tabasco sauce, a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and ice. Strain into a shot glass and add a slice of jalapeno pepper if you like. Fill a second glass with a shot of tequila. Drink the tequila, then chase it with the tomato mix.\nMore Tips for Making a Great Sangrita\nThe Tequila. It's tempting to be cheap when it comes to tequila you intend to shoot. Why bother spending a few extra dollars when it's gone in seconds, right? While you don't need to fork over a large amount of cash for this or any tequila shot, it is important to choose one that you wouldn't mind drinking a little slower.\nYes, the chaser will clean your palate and ease the shock from a less-than-ideal tequila. If, however, you start with a decent tequila, the entire drinking experience will be just a little bit better. When it comes to choosing a style of tequila, a blanco or reposado will do just fine.\nSangrita for a Crowd. The recipes above are for a single drink and can easily be multiplied to make a large batch of Sangrita. Simply store the mix in the refrigerator until needed.\nFor this, it's recommended to blend the mixture, which is another option if using fresh-picked tomatoes as opposed to store-bought juice. This is convenient for parties and those who enjoy a Sangrita every now and then (it's a tasty sipper and you don't have to shoot it).\nCustomize Your Sangrita. You have many options when it comes to the ingredients of either Sangrita recipe. You might want to use grapefruit or pineapple juice instead of orange, or substitute the grenadine with agave nectar or simple syrup. \nIn the tomato version, think about spicing it up with onion powder, ginger, salt, Maggi seasoning, celery salt, ground pepper, wasabi, or other chile peppers. Either version can have a little coriander or mint added for contrast.\nThere are no rules with Sangrita, so just have fun with it!\nHow Strong Are These Sangrita Shots?\nIf you think about it, the second step in this two-part shooter simply cuts the strength of the tequila in half. Both glasses will have the same volume: one is filled with alcohol while the other has none. This means that if you pour an 80-proof tequila and follow it with the Sangrita, you're essentially drinking a 40-proof shot even if it's not mixed.\nThe effect of the tequila will be the same, you're simply giving your stomach a little more substance to combat it.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sangrita-shooter-recipe-759805

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThere are a handful of ""melon"" vodkas on the market. This recipe was intended to use vodka flavored with a blend of various melons, including honeydew, cantaloupe, and watermelon. Some vodkas use watermelon alone, and that will work just fine.\nYou can also make your own melon vodka. It\'s an easy infusion that should take about a week and can be created with your own custom blend of melons.\nFor the cucumber, you might want to use an English cucumber rather than the average slicer. The English variety is less bitter because the seeds are smaller. Since they are so tiny, it\'s usually not bothersome if a few sneak through the strainer.\nIf you\'re using cucumber with larger seeds, you might want to fine strain the drink. This simply entails pouring through the shaker\'s regular strainer as well as a fine-mesh strainer that\'s placed over the glass. The second strainer should catch all the seeds and cucumber bits.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you\'re entertaining, mix up a small pitcher rather than individual drinks. Simply multiply each of the ingredients for the number of servings you need, stir it well with ice, and strain it into the serving pitcher. Store it in the refrigerator and it will be ready to pour into cocktail glasses.\nMake this drink tall by straining it over ice in a collins or highball glass. Fill it with ginger ale or a citrus soda. You could even use your favorite sparkling wine.\nAnother option is to make cucumber-flavored simple syrup, which would reduce this to a two-ingredient drink. It\'s incredibly easy and a lot like making ginger simple syrup, you\'ll simply need to switch to slices of cucumber.\nHow Strong Is a Melon Cucumber-tini?\nThe majority of commercial flavored vodkas are bottled at just 70 proof, but if you do a homemade infusion, you\'ll likely use an 80-proof vodka. Taking an average of the two, the melon cucumber-tini should have an alcohol content in the 24 percent ABV (48 proof) range. It\'s equivalent to drinking a cosmopolitan.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/melon-cucumber-tini-759811

Before you try it out at a party, you may want to practice making it on your own to ensure everything goes well when you're in the spotlight!\nThe actual amount you pour of each ingredient will vary depending on the size of your shot glass. Aim for each layer filling one-third of the glass and you'll be fine.\nThe key to any layered shot is to pour the ingredients in the order of their specific gravity: heaviest liquid first, lightest last. Grenadine is a very thick syrup, which is why it's almost always on the bottom. Cr?me de menthe falls in the middle because it includes a great deal of sugar, just like all cr?me liqueurs. Peppermint schnapps is the lightest of the bunch because, as you may have guessed, it has the least amount of sugar as well as the most alcohol.\nKeep in mind that there is a white cr?me de menthe available. While it will create the same taste and has the same density, the Christmas theme would not be complete without the green version. If you only have white cr?me de menthe, simply stir in a couple drops of green food coloring before pouring the shot.\nPeppermint schnapps can vary greatly from one brand to another, though most should float just fine on top of the green layer. You will get the most distinct top layer if you use a higher proof schnapps, which can be up to 100-proof (50 percent ABV). It's possible that an 80-proof schnapps will sink into the cr?me de menthe layer. This will not affect the drink's taste, just the visual effect.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to give the Santa shot a chocolate twist and cut back on its mintiness, there's a simple solution: pour white cr?me de cacao that's been tinted green with food coloring. It has nearly the same density as cr?me de menthe, so it should layer up just as well.\nIn a similar manner, the white layer can be swapped out for a number of other ingredients. Vodka would be an excellent choice, as would tequila. Both should float perfectly and take some of the mintiness out of the drink.\nHow Strong Is a Santa Shot?\nThe strength of the two liqueurs will affect the shot's intensity and both can vary. Cr?me de menthe is generally bottled around 50 proof and, for this example, let's assume you pour 100-proof peppermint schnapps. With no dilution to factor in because it's a layered shot, it will be around 25 percent ABV (50 proof). That's the same as a straight shot of cr?me de menthe, only with a fruity twist!\n11 Traditional Christmas Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/santa-shot-shooter-759806

It is truly a unique flavor combination but worth trying if you're a big fan of black licorice.\nMake a dirty licorice ball by layering 1/3 ounce each of coffee liqueur (Kahlua is common), sambuca, and Irish cream in that order. Add the drop of grenadine if you like.\nWhy Isn't It Called a Slippery Nipple Anymore?\nThis shot came out of a time when drinks in bars were given names that were guaranteed to grab your attention. During the last few decades of the 20th century, many of the names were rude, lewd, or, like this one, suggestive. It likely received the slippery nipple name because of the grenadine (some bartenders use a cherry) in the middle of the drink, symbolizing its namesake. In an attempt to maintain popular bar drinks and drop the offensive language, the bartending community and drinkers are giving these provocative drinks new names. While the name may have changed, the licorice ball is still the same great drink.\nHow Strong Is the Licorice Ball Shot?\nSambuca is not a weak liquor and it is often bottled at 42 percent ABV (84 proof), which is higher than the average vodka, tequila, or gin. With that in mind, any licorice ball made with sambuca is going to be stronger than many mixed shots. There's no dilution, either, so its alcohol content is a hefty 28 percent ABV (56 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/slippery-nipple-shot-recipes-759813

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf your preference is dry wine, tonic water can bring balance to a wine that is simply too sweet to drink.\nClub soda, seltzer, or soda are great choices for the spritz. There are many flavored seltzers on the market these days to choose from. Q Drinks and Fever-Tree are designed to be mixed into drinks, whereas ginger ale or a lemon-lime soda would sweeten up a wine, too.\nHard seltzers are popular alternatives to club soda; the light flavoring common in seltzers can be a nice complement to a variety of wines.\nVariations\nChange the flavor of your spritzer with ice. Here are some suggestions for add-ins and other ways to enjoy your wine spritzer.\nFreeze herbs or edible flowers in your ice cube trays. Borage's delicate blue flowers look fantastic and add a hint of cucumber to the drink. Rosemary, lavender, and mint are delightful as well.\nFrozen berries (or small berries frozen in water) are tasty additions. Freezing grapes offers a quick way to chill any wine spritzer with no dilution. Melon balls are also a fun option.\nStick a frozen fruit pop in your spritzer in the summer. The longer it takes to drink it, the more fruit will infuse into the drink. Use a glass wide enough to fit the ice pop and place it top-side down; the stick also lets you stir it. Berry, peach, and mango ice pops add a nice splash of flavor. For a boozy kick, you may even think about creating poptails for your spritzers.\nHow Strong Is the White Wine Spritzer?\nThe white wine spritzer is a very mild mixed drink. The only alcohol in it is wine, which tends to range from 8 to 14 percent ABV.\n\nFor example, when a 10 percent ABV wine is watered down in the spritzer, the drink will have an alcohol content around 6 percent ABV. It really is one of the gentlest drinks you can mix up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/white-wine-spritzer-759850

It's also a convenient excuse to explore bottles that may be new to you. Some recommendations include Papa's Pilar Dark 24, Plantation Original Dark, and Zacapa 23. For bottles more in the $20 price range, the go-to favorites of Goslings Black Seal and Myers's Original Dark are good choices.\nFor the dry vermouth, the key consideration is that it's fresh. Once the bottle is open, the fortified wine will begin to go stale after a couple of months. If you use it only on occasion, get in the habit of dating the label (month, year) when you crack a bottle and pick up a replacement whenever two or three months have passed.\nFresh pineapple juice is going to produce a better tasting cocktail. If you don't have a juicer, muddle a few chunks of the fruit very well, then strain out the solids. It won't take much to get 1 1/2 ounces.\nIf you're going to buy pineapple juice and don't drink it often, go with small cans. This will eliminate waste because the large cans are difficult to seal well enough to keep the juice fresh.\nRecipe Variations\nThe other popular serving option is to blend this cocktail: Combine the ingredients in a blender with 3/4 cup ice (about 4 cubes) and blend until smooth. Pour into a chilled hurricane glass.\nFor a garnish, place a chunk of pineapple on a cocktail pick or drape a long orange peel over the rim. Then again, in pure tiki cocktail fashion, you could go with both or really go all out and pile on all sorts of fruit, especially for the frozen version.\nHow Strong Is a Yaka Hula Hickey Dula?\nPouring an equal amount of pineapple juice helps keep this cocktail in a comfortable range as far as alcohol content goes. It's neither too light nor too strong, weighing in around 17 percent ABV (34 proof) when made with 80-proof rum.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/yaka-hula-hickey-dula-759854

Stir in a few drops of food coloring if you want to customize the color.\nPour into shot glasses, molds, or a baking pan for a sheet of gelatin to cut up after it sets.\nRefrigerate until the liquid sets up; at least 2 hours, but overnight is recommended. Serve cold and enjoy.\nTips\nThe key to spiking jello is to keep the liquor and other ingredients in check. While it may be tempting to pour more whiskey, this can result in jello that won't set all the way. It creates a big mess unless you serve it in a hands-free way like plastic shot cups or with miniature spoons. Even then, it can be more like slime than jello and leaves a bit to be desired.\nTo prevent a jello disaster, always make sure your liquid ingredients add up to no more than 2 cups. One cup of that needs to be boiling water and the 1/4 cup of cold water should also remain (though it's not as critical). Just keep in mind that whatever you add to the liquid volume of one ingredient needs to be taken off of another ingredient.\nRecipe Variation\nYou can use lemon-flavored gelatin, but you will need to make adjustments. First of all, you'll need to use a full 3-ounce package of lemon jello for the same volume of liquids. Unflavored gelatin (like that made by Knox) is much more concentrated than flavored gelatins, which add sugar as well as the flavoring ingredient.\nAlso with lemon jello, you might find that your whiskey sour jello shots are a little too sour. Cutting the lemon juice to 1 or 1 1/2 ounces will take care of that; make up the difference with extra simple syrup or whiskey.\nHow Strong Is a Whiskey Jello Shot?\nNot only are jello shots fun to eat, but they're also rather light on the alcohol. If you stick to the recipe and use an 80-proof whiskey, these jello shots weigh in at just 7 percent ABV (14 proof). Take it slow though because it's easy to have one too many of these tasty little shots.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiskey-sour-jelly-shot-759848

Rather than your drip machine, try other brewing methods such as a pour-over brewer, moka pot, or French press, to make the richest, darkest coffee possible.\nBe sure to let your coffee to chill before mixing the cocktail. If the coffee's hot, the ice in the shaker will melt almost instantly. A few minutes in the refrigerator or freezer will get hot coffee to the perfect temperature.\nAnother option is to use cold brew coffee. This brewing method never adds heat but does take about 12 hours to brew, so you have to plan ahead. With freshly ground coffee beans, it produces a wonderfully rich, flavorful cup that's perfect for cold coffee cocktails.\nGarnishing any espresso martini with three whole coffee beans is a bit of a tradition. It stems from Italy's coffee sambuca drink in which the beans symbolize health, happiness, and prosperity.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer vodka over rum, make this drink with a vanilla-flavored vodka instead. It's a popular flavor and many of the best-known brands produce one so it's not hard to find.\nYou can also try a vanilla whiskey, such as that from Crown Royal or Jim Beam.\nNo matter the base spirit you choose, it's easy to do a DIY vanilla infusion. All you need is a vanilla bean or two and about four days. It's a nice option if your favorite liquor brand doesn't produce a vanilla alternative.\nWhile Kahlua may be the most popular coffee liqueur on the market, there are more worth trying. Look for craft coffee liqueurs such as those from Firelit, Leopold Bros., St. George Spirits, or New Deal.\nCoffee lovers will enjoy homemade coffee liqueur as well. It offers the opportunity to customize the flavor to your exact taste and lets you choose your favorite coffee beans.\nHow Strong Is a Bacchus Espresso Martini?\nCruzan Vanilla Rum, like most flavored liquors, is bottled at a lower proof than regular rums. Since it weighs in at just 21 percent ABV (42 proof), which is equal to the Kahlua, this is a very low-proof martini perfect for a casual drink. On average, it's alcohol content will be 13 percent ABV (26 proof), making it equivalent to enjoying a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bacchus-espresso-martini-760515

Combine the flesh off of three or four passion fruits (seeds are okay) with a 750 ml bottle of vodka in an infusion jar. Let it infuse for about three days. Check the flavor after the second day, then every day after until it reaches your desired flavor. Strain through a fine mesh strainer to remove the passion fruit and bottle under a tight seal.\nA clean-tasting, smooth light rum will work best in this cocktail.\nTry to choose a high-end triple sec such as Cointreau. An orange cura?ao is a good option as well.\nFresh-squeezed lemon juice will finish the cocktail off perfectly. The average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces of juice, more than enough for three drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you like, serve this cocktail over ice in an old-fashioned glass.\nWhile Angostura Aromatic Bitters is recommended, try the passion pearl with other flavors. Orange bitters are a great choice, and celery, grapefruit, and lavender bitters can add an interesting accent as well.\nThis same recipe can work well for other flavored vodkas. Try it with berry, grapefruit, melon, or pear vodka.\nFlavor-infused rum is not out of the question either. Adding it to the passion fruit vodka will make the drink multi-dimensional. Lemon, peach, and mango rums are all excellent options.\nHow Strong Is a Passion Pearl?\nThe passion pearl has a wonderful flavor, but it's important to keep in mind that drinks like this are pretty potent.

Produced by several brands, Frangelico is the most common and often preferred in the chocolate cake shot. It is a premium brand and has a price tag to match. If you intend to primarily use it in shots, coffee, and other casual drinks, another brand will do just fine and likely save some money.\nRecipe Variations\nSome drinkers prefer the chocolate cake shot made with 1 ounce of hazelnut liqueur and 1/2 ounce of vodka.\nOther flavored vodkas, particularly berry vodkas, can create a delicious shot as well.\nWhile this shot\'s alternative name is ""birthday cake shot,"" newer, creamier recipes also go by that name.

Set it aside.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the vodka, pomegranate liqueur, and grapefruit juice. Fill with ice.\nShake and strain into the prepared glass.\nGarnish with a lemon wedge. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThough the recipe calls for pink grapefruit, the red variety of the citrus fruit will work just fine in this cocktail.\nFresh grapefruit juice will definitely make a better tasting cocktail. The citrus is at its best during the winter months when it will be sweetest and offer the most juice. On average, a single grapefruit should yield between 5 and 6 ounces of juice, which is plenty for a few blushing lady cocktails.\nGenerally, martinis are the place to show off your best vodka and that's great advice for this recipe as well. Since Pama does have such a strong presence in the drink and a bolder flavor, you can get away with a mid-shelf vodka if you want to save a little money. You'll barely notice the difference.\nRecipe Variations\nDid you run out of Pama? Grenadine is a quick fix that offers the same pomegranate flavor. Since it is a syrup, it will be sweeter than the liqueur. When using it as a substitute, cut back to 1/2 ounce of grenadine and make up the difference with a little more vodka and juice.\nTry this recipe with a flavored vodka to add a little more dimension. Citrus, pineapple, and other tropical fruits are all really nice pairings for both pomegranate and grapefruit. You could even give cucumber or ginger vodka a shot!\nSwitch out the vodka for blanco tequila or light rum if you prefer. It would also be a nice drink for the aged types of either spirit.\nIf you swap the grapefruit juice out for an orange liqueur and change up the proportions slightly, you can make a delightful Pama martini. The two make a great pair to offer guests at the same party without significantly increasing the cost.\nWhen you're not in the mood for a martini, transform this mix into a tall, refreshing cocktail. Keep the vodka and Pama pours the same, double up on the grapefruit juice, fill your glass with ice, then top the drink off with club soda.\nHow Strong Is a Blushing Lady?\nThis blushing lady looks all sweet and innocent, but she's a feisty gal! While it's not the strongest martini you can mix up, the alcohol content will fall into the 22 percent ABV (44 proof) range.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blushing-lady-recipe-761016

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with fresh blueberries (skewered on a cocktail pick or floated on top of the drink).\nRecipe Variations\nThis martini would be excellent with either gin or tequila if you want to skip the vodka. If using gin, consider one with a softer profile. Blanco tequila would also be a great choice.\nFor a really interesting twist, mix this drink up with whiskey. Be sure to choose a smooth whiskey without too many bold flavors; steer clear of rye whiskeys or high-proof, bold bourbons.\nTips\nIf you can't find blueberry juice at the market, you can make your own without a juicer. Simply muddle a handful of fresh berries in the cocktail shaker until you get the amount of juice needed. Strain out the pieces of fruit, add the remaining ingredients, and shake it up. Or you can add the juice with the pieces of berry and then double strain the drink into your serving glass.\nTo make your own mango juice, you will need a good juicer. Although not that common, you might be able to find mango juice at the store.\nAnother option is to use mango nectar as a substitute. It's typically sold in cans and can be found near the juices at many grocers.\nHow Strong Is a Blueberry Martini?\nThe blueberry martini is a surprisingly light drink. The fruit juices help bring it down to a pleasant 15 percent ABV (30 proof). It's as if you're drinking a glass of wine, only fruitier.\nDo I need to chill the glass?\nA cold glass is one of the keys to making a great cocktail, and there are several ways to chill your barware, from freezing to plunging in a bowl of ice. Since this drink is not served on the rocks (over ice), the cold martini glass helps keep the cocktail at the right temperature while sipping.\nWhat Are Blueberries?""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blueberry-martini-recipe-761015

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo make the strawberry easier to muddle, cut it into three or four thin slices. Choose a large berry and be sure to rinse it well under cold water and remove the green cap.\nA single lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces. To make it easy, simply squeeze the juice from half of a fruit directly into the shaker.\nDry wines bring balance to the drink, offsetting the other ingredients' sweetness perfectly. Look for the word brut on sparkling wine labels and avoid those with sec, as that indicates a sweet wine.\nSince ros? wine can be either sweet or dry and it won't always be labeled brut, you can also look for bottles made with dry red wine grapes. These include Grenache, Cinsault, and Syrah; French Provencial ros? Champagnes and those from Spain's Tavel region are often dry as well.\nRecipe Variations\nCitrus vodka can build on this cocktail's delicate fruit flavor and is a nice substitute for regular vodka.\nThe recommended gin that can replace the vodka is Hendrick's Gin. It is softer than most and the gin's cucumber and rose flavors are delightful with the elderflower and strawberry. It's an ideal match for the dry sparkling wine as well.\nIf you prefer, a nice Brut Champagne is a good choice too.\nHow Strong Is a Cherub's Cup?\nFor a wine cocktail, the Cherub's cup is surprisingly strong. Even though wine makes up the largest volume, the two liquors bump its alcohol content up to 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

If you don't have time or room in the freezer to frost the glass, give it a quick chill instead. Simply place a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix the drink, then dump them out before straining.\nBlavod can be hard to find. It typically makes an appearance at liquor stores around Halloween, if it's not available regularly. It's the only black vodka on the market, so your options are extremely limited.\nIf you cannot find or do not wish to use Blavod, you can turn your favorite vodka into a black one by using this simple method. The trick is nothing more than the right combination of food coloring and, though it's not the perfect black found in Blavod, it works.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can certainly pour a clear vodka in this martini. Obviously, it won't have the black color, but the gold flakes will still catch your eye floating around in the clear liquid.\nAmong your flavored vodka options that will work with the cinnamon, vanilla vodka is the best choice. You could also have some fun with dessert vodkas like whipped cream or marshmallow.\nHow Strong Is a Black and Gold Martini?\nGoldschl?ger's a pretty potent schnapps, bottled at 87 proof. When paired with the 80-proof vodka, this martini is one of the strongest you can mix up. Its alcohol content is 35 percent ABV (70 proof), outweighing even the likes of the vodka martini.

The recommended vodka and raspberry liqueur are high-end, so be sure to choose a triple sec of comparable quality. Cointreau and Combier are two excellent options.\nChambord is the best-known brand of black raspberry liqueur, though there are other options available, including a very nice one made by Bols. You can even use a red raspberry liqueur without changing the flavor profile much.\nRecipe Variations\nYou certainly can mix this cocktail up with a straight blueberry vodka?even making your own infusion?rather than Van Gogh's blend. The flavor will be slightly less dynamic, but still enjoyable.\nAnother option is to use a clear vodka. The Chambord alone gives the cosmo a nice twist. If you want to bring the blueberry flavor back into the drink, muddle some fresh blueberries in the shaker before adding the other ingredients. Frozen blueberries would work, too, but should be thawed first.\nThough cranberry is the juice of choice for a cosmo, feel free to pour another red fruit juice if you like. Pomegranate would be fantastic.\nYou can also switch to white cranberry juice (it's actually light brown in color). It's not quite as sweet as the red variety and is a really nice substitute.\nHow Strong Is a Very Berry Cosmo?\nThe very berry cosmo falls right in line with other vodka martinis when it comes to its strength. When made with the suggested brands, it weighs in around 23 percent ABV (46 proof). It's not a light drink, so do be careful because the sweet fruits can trick you into drinking one too many.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/very-berry-cosmo-recipe-761204

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis latte is also great when the ingredients are shaken with ice then strained over fresh ice. Or, strain it into two cocktail glasses for vanilla latte martinis.\nTo reduce water dilution, freeze chilled coffee into ice cubes to use for this drink.\nFor the cream liqueur, RumChata and Irish cream are fantastic options. Heavy cream, half and half, and whole milk are good substitutes, as are vanilla-flavored plant milks such as almond or soy.\nWhat's the Best Way to Brew Coffee for Cocktails?\nJust like any latte, espresso is preferred over standard drip-brewed coffee because it's more flavorful. You can also use other brewing methods, such as a drip cone or French press. Another option is to use cold-brewed coffee. It takes about 12 hours to make because there's no heat involved, but this method produces a rich, thick coffee with a true flavor of the beans. Get in the habit of always having some in the refrigerator, and you'll see an improvement in every iced coffee (spiked and not) you make.\nBe sure to thoroughly chill hot-brewed coffee before using it in an iced coffee drink. For a quick chill, place a cup in the freezer for about 10 minutes.\nRecipe Variations\nMake the drink with hot coffee for a warm, spiked cup of joe.\nSwitch to vanilla whiskey or rum for a little more depth.\nAdd extra flavor with a splash of cinnamon syrup or caramel syrup.\nYou can also make a spiked latte with other flavored liquors. Try coconut rum or vodka, cinnamon whiskey, whipped cream vodka, or go fruity with a berry-flavored vodka.\nBring in another liqueur to complement or replace the cream. Try a honey liqueur for extra sweetness, or give it a nutty twist with amaretto or hazelnut liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a Vanilla Latte?\nThis may be a spiked latte, but it's not particularly strong. The alcohol content is similar to wine, at around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).\nCan Vanilla Extract Be Used to Make Vanilla Vodka?\nDue to the high cost of vanilla beans, it is tempting to make vanilla vodka with vanilla extract. However, the added flavor will be negligible. If you want to try it, use 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract (not imitation) per 1 cup of vodka. For a truer and deeper vanilla flavor, make a vanilla bean-infused vodka instead:\nIn a large jar, add three whole vanilla beans (split lengthwise) to 750-milliliters of vodka.\nShake daily and infuse for 5 to 7 days. (If you use fewer vanilla beans, it will take longer.)\nRemove the vanilla beans when it reaches your desired flavor.\n14 Knock-Out Iced Coffee Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/vanilla-latte-cocktail-recipe-761201

The heavy fruit flavors mean you can get away with a smooth budget-friendly vodka and likely won't notice the difference.\nTo create the freshest white carnation, use fresh-squeezed orange juice. You can expect to get between 2 and 3 ounces of juice from the average orange, so one fruit is enough for a single cocktail.\nFor the soda water, choose a clean, flavorless carbonated water. Club soda will do if you don't have mineral water or seltzer available.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile unflavored soda is preferred for the original white carnation, ginger ale or a lemon-lime soda are good choices.\nPour a flavored vodka if you like. Citrus and vanilla vodkas would be excellent choices. You can also add a little more dimension with fruit flavors that complement the orange; try berry, grapefruit, pineapple, or pomegranate vodkas.\nTransform the white carnation into a boozy smoothie! Combine the vodka, peach schnapps, and orange juice in a blender with a scoop of ice cream and a few ice cubes. Blend until smooth.\nIf you skip the white carnation's soda and cream, you have the popular hairy navel cocktail.\nGive this drink a bliss on the beach twist by splitting the orange juice equally with cranberry juice.\nHow Strong Is a White Carnation?\nThe white carnation is a pretty mild cocktail that's as strong as similar vodka juice or soda highballs, including the screwdriver.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFor the apple slice, green apples are preferred in UV Vodka's original recipe. If you only have a red apple, it will look just as nice and bring a little visual contrast to the drink.\nEither way, dip the slices in lemon juice immediately after cutting them. If you don't, the white flesh will begin to turn brown within minutes due to oxidation. Cut a small slit in each slice so it can easily be slipped onto the rim of your glass.\nA piece of soft caramel candy is a fun treat to go along with this drink. It's not easy to add to the glass rim, though, so you'll have to get creative. A quick option is to stab the candy with a cocktail skewer and place it at the bottom of the glass. The drinker can then pull it out and eat the candy whenever they like.\nAnother garnish option is to cut a full apple slice that will float on top of the drink. You can rest the caramel candy on top of this to create a mini boat.\nYou can also drizzle a little caramel ice cream topping over the apple or in the glass before pouring the drink. Just be sure to keep it inside the glass or you'll have a sticky mess.\nVariations\nCaramel and toffee apple martinis are very popular and there are other recipes that combine the same sweet flavors. If you have a clear apple vodka, you can get the same green color by pouring a sour apple schnapps like Apple Pucker. Simple shake up 1 1/2 ounces apple vodka and 1 ounce each of apple and butterscotch schnapps.\nFor a similar drink, switch to tequila, let apple cider take over the fruitiness, and mix up a caramel apple pie cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Caramel Appletini?\nWith only two liquors and no mixers in this martini, you can expect it to be pretty potent. However, the vodka is just 60 proof (not 80 proof, like most) and most butterscotch schnapps are bottled at 30 proof, so the martini is lighter than you might expect. It will shake up to just 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

Many premium brands offer citrus vodka because it's one of the most popular flavors, so you'll find plenty of great options to choose from.\nCr?me de fraises is a sweet strawberry liqueur produced by a number of brands. Look for bottles from Gabriel Bourdier, Giffard, Lejay, and Massenez. It's not the most prolific bottle in liquor stores, but it is out there if you search for it.\nFeel free to use any other strawberry liqueur, including those from Bols, Fragoli, and Marie Brizard. Avoid creamy strawberry options like Tequila Rose.\nFresh lemon juice is going to make a better-tasting cocktail. You can typically get 1 3/4 ounces of juice out of a single lemon, so it's nearly enough for two drinks.\nTo maximize the juice, let your lemon reach room temperature (if stored in the refrigerator) and roll it under the palm of your hand before juicing.\nRecipe Variations\nCitrus vodkas are typically a blend of various citrus fruit flavors. This drink would be just as good with a single citrus. Try it with a lemon or orange vodka; grapefruit would be very interesting as well.\nYou can also make this into a fun and tasty party shot. For that, pour equal parts strawberry liqueur and vodka, then add a splash of lemon.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Martini?\nIf you're looking for a casual vodka martini that's not too strong, this is the perfect recipe.

Fortunately, there are many budget-friendly vodkas on the market today that taste great and are perfect for cocktails like this.\nA fun garnish for the red lotus is three pitted lychees skewered on a cocktail pick. You can also stuff the lychee with cranberries or blueberries (similar to this eyeball garnish, but without the ""gore"").\nRecipe Variations\nServe this drink a little taller by straining it into a highball glass then topping it with a light soda (e.g., club soda, lemon-lime, ginger ale) or sparkling wine. The strawberry notes in sparkling ros? would be a lovely addition.\nThis drink can also be made by the pitcher for a small party. You might want to switch the ratio slightly, pouring 1 part each vodka and lychee liqueur with 2 parts cranberry juice to lower the alcohol content.\nAdd a hint of citrus by garnishing the drink with a lime wedge, which the drinker can squeeze into the mix if they like. A twist of lime peel expressed over the drink then laid on the rim is nice as well.\nPour a flavored vodka to give the drink more depth. Citrus and vanilla vodkas are excellent choices, though you could add a complementary flavor such as any berry or apple.\nLighten up the drink by pouring white cranberry juice rather than the more common red variety. It tends to be less sweet and has more of a white grape juice profile.\nHow Strong Is a Red Lotus?\nFor a sweet drink, the red lotus is surprisingly potent. Since it is served short and most of the volume is made up of liquor, its alcohol content will be 20 percent ABV (40 proof) or so. That\'s half the strength of the vodka on its own and similar to the cosmopolitan.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-lotus-cocktail-recipe-761149

Fill with ice and shake until well-chilled.\nFine strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a spanked sage leaf. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSpanking your sage?including the leaves you muddle?between your palms will wake up the herb's essence and make it more flavorful. It's a trick many bartenders use with mint and works with any leafy herb.\nFine straining this cocktail by using both a regular strainer and pouring it through a fine-mesh sieve is important. It will remove any bits of sage and cucumber and leave your drink cleaner.\nWhile the average slicer cucumber works find here, you might want to consider using an English cucumber instead. They tend to be sweeter and less bitter than the more common variety, the skin is not waxed, and the seeds are almost unnoticeable.\nFresh sage should be stored in the refrigerator, preferably wrapped in paper towels and placed in a plastic bag. It should be good for up to five days.\nIf the leaves begin to wilt, freeze them and thaw the leaves thoroughly before mixing the cocktail. Don't wait too long; after about a week in the freezer, the leaves will be better for food than drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, make your own mango-infused vodka. Simply wash and cut the fruit into chunks and place it in your favorite vodka. The infusion should take about one week.\nCointreau is the recommended orange liqueur, but it's not your only option. You can use another high-end triple sec, try orange cura?ao, or opt for a brandy-based liqueur like Grand Marnier.\nNo sage? While there's no really good substitute for the herb, rosemary is a good alternative that will work nicely in this cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Sage Lady?\nUnlike many flavored vodkas, Absolut Mango is bottled at full 80-proof strength. That means this lovely martini is not going to be a weak drink. In fact, its alcohol content is right in line with other vodka martinis, weighing in at 23 percent ABV (46 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sage-lady-cocktail-recipe-761159

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFor the pomegranate liqueur, choose a premium option that matches the quality of the vodka and Campari. Look for brands like Bols, Drillaud, Gabriel Boudier, Fair, Pama, and Pocheta.\nSimple syrup can be found at a variety of stores, though it's very easy to make yourself and doing so can save money. Homemade simple syrup requires nothing more than sugar and water. It can be made on the stovetop or, if you're in a pinch for time, simply shaken up.\nRecipe Variations\nThis recipe originally included 1 ounce of pomegranate juice. Considering that there's already a liqueur of that flavor and the juice is very thick, that has been removed because it was simply too much and did not add dimension. The liqueur alone creates a well-balanced drink, but feel free to bring the juice back to see which version you enjoy most.\nTry a flavored vodka, such as citrus or vanilla in this cocktail. Pomegranate vodkas are a way to double up on that flavor and a lighter option than the juice.\nIt can also be made with gin or whiskey, if you prefer. Gin is a natural companion for Campari (e.g., Negroni) and a good pairing for pomegranate. Likewise, whiskey and Campari are found in cocktails like the Boulevardier; the fruit is a nice bridge between the two flavors.\nHow Strong Is a Red Carpet Cocktail?\nLike most vodka martinis, the red carpet is a potent little cocktail. Its average alcohol content is 23 percent ABV (46 proof), similar to the cosmopolitan. Drinking too many of these will set you up for a nasty hangover in the morning.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-carpet-cocktail-recipe-761151

With this recipe, you will get the same great flavor as the original, just in a slightly different form. To make it, combine 1 ounce vodka with 1/2 ounce Chambord and a splash of lemon-lime soda in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake well. Strain into a shot glass.\nJust as there is an ""up"" version of the kamikaze, it\'s easy to transform the raspberry gimlet into a martini cocktail. Simply shake 1 1/2 ounces vodka or gin with 1-ounce black raspberry liqueur and 1/2 ounce fresh lime juice with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with seasonal berries.\nHow Strong Is the Raspberry Gimlet Shot?\nWhen made with 80-proof vodka and Chambord, the raspberry gimlet shot has an alcohol content in the 24 percent ABV (48 proof) range. Shaking up the martini formula pops that up to 30 percent ABV (60 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo create honey syrup, combine 1/2 ounce of water with 1/2 ounce of honey. You can certainly make as much as you like, just keep the proportions equal.\nIf you cannot find ginger vodka at the store, it is very easy to do your own infusion. You will need fresh ginger, your favorite vodka, and at least one week for the infusion (it may take up to two weeks).\nFresh lemon juice is definitely preferred for this cocktail because the bottled varieties are often sweetened, which will throw off the drink's balance. The average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces of juice, more than enough for two drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nCandied ginger pieces make a delightful garnish alternative. Skewer them onto a cocktail pick and lay it inside the drink.\nSimple syrup or agave nectar can be used as substitutes for the honey syrup.\nIf you can't wait for the vodka infusion to shake up this martini, use your favorite clear vodka and replace the honey syrup with ginger simple syrup. Citrus or vanilla vodkas would also work nicely.\nTransform this martini into a tall, refreshing highball. Strain it over ice in a highball glass and top the drink with club soda. It becomes a sort of homemade spiked ginger soda that's fantastic on hot summer days!\nHow Strong Is a Red Over Heels?\nThe red over heels recipe is milder than the average vodka martini because vodka's the only liquor. That makes it a pleasant drink for a casual afternoon and you can expect it to have an alcohol content around 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

These versions tend to be creamier and build on that hazelnut-vodka base with the addition of coffee liqueur and milk. To make it, pour 1 ounce each of vodka, coffee liqueur, Irish cream, and Frangelico over ice in a chilled highball glass. Top with milk or cream and stir well. Alternatively, shake the ingredients then strain over fresh ice.\nSome versions of the shot shake 1/3 ounce each of hazelnut and coffee liqueurs, Irish cream, and vodka, then strain the mix into a shot glass.\nAmaretto is a common substitute for the drink's hazelnut liqueur.\nHow Strong Are the Nutty Fix Drinks?\nLayered shots are often very strong because there's no ice dilution. This makes the nutty fix shooters close to the combined bottling strength of the liqueurs used. Its alcohol content is around 23 percent ABV (46 proof). The highball version is lighter but still weighs in at 16 percent ABV (32 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/russian-qualude-recipes-761158

Let stand for 5 seconds.\nFill with ice, and shake vigorously.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nTips\nUse ice cubes rather than crushed ice, if you like. The crushed form will create a slightly slushier drink because it's already partially broken down, but the cubes will work just fine. Be sure to shake a little longer when using cubes.\nFor the banana liqueur, look for bottles of 99 Bananas, Marie Brizard, Bols, DeKuyper, and Hiram Walker. Some of these are labeled banana schnapps.\nHeavy cream is used most often for dairy cocktails. Pouring milk or a dairy alternative will result in a very light drink, or you could take the middle ground and use half-and-half.\nIf you want to eliminate a bottle and skip the espresso vodka, pour an extra dash of coffee liqueur. It works the other way if you only have the vodka in your bar.\nRecipe Variations\nTransform this cocktail into a frozen treat. There's a popular recipe called a chocolate monkey that is very similar to this recipe. It's typically a blend of vodka, cr?me de cacao, and banana liqueur with either ice or chocolate ice cream (or both). You can use Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate and banana liqueur alone or add the coffee ingredients for extra dimension.\nTry this mix to start: 1 1/2 ounces chocolate vodka, 1 ounce banana liqueur, 1/2 ounce espresso vodka and/or coffee liqueur, 1 scoop of chocolate ice cream. Blend until smooth. Vanilla ice cream works, too.\nAlternatively, keep the talking monkey's cream and use 1 cup of ice (about 5 or 6 cubes).\nHow Strong Is a Talking Monkey?\nVan Gogh bottles their flavored vodkas at 70 proof rather than vodka's standard 80 proof. Adding the cream to that results in a relatively light cocktail compared to most martini-style drinks. On average, the alcohol content of this recipe should be 16 percent ABV (32 proof), or just slightly stronger than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/talking-monkey-recipe-761185

Fill with ice, and shake well.\nStrain into the prepared glass.\nFor a blood effect, drizzle grenadine down the side of the glass.\nGarnish with a chocolate-dipped orange slice.\nTips\nThe webbing can be tricky and you might want to practice before the party to perfect your method. The glasses can be kept frozen until the party, too.\nTo get a nice, clean effect with the chocolate syrup, you'll need a syrup that is not too runny and you will want to put the glass into the freezer immediately to stop any flow on the inside of the glass. Also, the webs will begin to disappear once the glass begins to warm, so remove them from the freezer just before straining.\nAs you pour, the grenadine will sink to the bottom of the glass, just like it does in the tequila sunrise.\nMake the chocolate-dipped orange slices ahead of time. For martini glasses, cutting a full slice into halves or quarters is a good fit. Melt chocolate in the microwave or a double boiler, then dunk one end of each orange slice in. Set them out on a parchment-lined baking sheet to set up.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you want a super clean, sharp look for your web decorations, skip the chocolate syrup. Instead, draw webbing with glass markers on the outside of the glasses. The markers are typically available at craft stores and some wash off while others will not. For this reason, don't use your good martini glasses; pick up inexpensive glassware for this party instead.\nHow Strong Is a Spider's Kiss Cocktail?\nLike most martinis, the spider's kiss is not as gentle as it looks.

Just look for the brand's other brightly colored vodkas, including the famous UV Blue.\nThere are other lemonade-flavored vodkas available now, though UV was one of the first. If you're looking for a substitute, try Deep Eddy Lemon or Svedka Strawberry Lemonade. Neither is bright pink and the flavor is not quite the same, but they will make a nice cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nAdding a splash of a lightly flavored soda (e.g., lemon-lime, ginger ale) can give this martini a nice fizz and make it even more refreshing. You could also go with a sparkling lemonade or a sparkling Italian soda.\nThis cocktail is also quite pleasant when served a little taller and on the rocks. The easiest way to increase the volume is to double up on both the juice and triple sec, adding a sparkling element (even a ros? wine) if you like. Switch to a double old-fashioned or highball glass or enjoy it in an ice-filled Mason jar.\nAs with the cosmo, feel free to adjust the cranberry juice and triple sec to suit your taste.

Just make sure to choose a premium brand with a clean, smooth taste so you can enjoy the drink at it's best.\nMany aperitifs, especially those featuring Campari, are served as very short drinks. You will notice that the Speranza follows suit, mixing up just over 2 ounces. Given Campari's bold, bitter flavor, this is actually a perfect serving; most people will want to move on to another beverage after the first cocktail.\nServing the drink over a single large piece of ice, such as an ice ball, rather than ice cubes will slow down the dilution while keeping your cocktail cold.\nRecipe Variations\nA top-shelf citrus vodka would be an excellent alternative for the Speranza cocktail.\nFollow the lead of the Negroni and mix this cocktail with gin rather than vodka.\nIf you prefer, stir the cocktail with ice for 30 seconds and strain it into a chilled cocktail glass. An orange twist would be an elegant garnish for this option.\nAdding a squeeze of fresh orange juice can really set this cocktail off nicely. Cut a wedge from the orange you cut the garnish from and squeeze it over the drink, then give the mix a quick stir.\nAdd a dash or two of bitters if you like.

There's no need to pour your best bottles, but you probably don't want to be too frugal. The drink will taste great with brands that fall somewhere in the middle.\nShaking breaks ice down significantly and it will melt faster, which is why it's always best to use fresh cubes in the serving glass. Using ice from your shaker will lead to an overly diluted drink.\nOther raspberry liqueurs can be used in the raven, though they might have a slightly different specific gravity than Chambord and may not float as well. The drink will taste the same, though.\nIt is likely that this drink will not fill really tall highball glasses. The liquid volume is about 4 ounces, so you'll want to be sure to use plenty of ice. If possible, choose a smaller volume thin glass or simply don't worry about filling the glass completely.\nHow Strong Is a Raven Cocktail?\nThe raven is a cool looking drink and its sweet taste is captivating, but it can be deceiving. The combination of four liquors creates a very potent mixed drink with an alcohol content around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nChoose a premium vodka for this cocktail to ensure the taste meets your expectations. Pouring a low-quality vodka will bring the drink's quality down and this is designed to be a fine cocktail, not just another J?germeister drink.\nFor the coffee liqueur, Kahlua may be the obvious choice because it's the most popular. There are others you might like to try, including Firelit and the coffee options from Leopold Bros., St. George Spirits, and New Deal. And, if you're in the mood for an experiment, this is a great recipe to try out a homemade coffee liqueur.\nThough you can adjust the ingredients to suit your taste, it's often best to keep the first three equal. Definitely try not to go overboard on the J?germeister in order to retain a good balance of flavors.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you need a touch more sweetness, add another drop of grenadine.\nThe J?ger caf? cocktail is an excellent cocktail to serve on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass.\nFor a fun twist, try a flavored vodka. Vanilla would be an excellent choice, as would an espresso vodka. You may enjoy citrus or berry vodkas as well.\nInstead of grenadine, you can use a pomegranate liqueur such as Pama. Alternatively, other red fruit liqueurs (e.g., strawberry, raspberry, or cherry) can be a good substitute.\nThere are no exact substitutions for J?germeister, though you can experiment with similar herbal blends in this drink. Some good options include Fernet Branca, Root Liqueur, and Underberg.\nHow Strong Is a J?ger Caf? Cocktail?\nThough not as strong a vodka martini, the J?ger caf? cocktail It's up there and definitely not a weak drink. On average, it has an alcohol content in the 25 percent ABV (50 proof) range, so it's wise to take it slow with this one.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/widow-maker-cocktail-recipe-761215

Serve and enjoy.\nIs there a difference between English lemonade and American lemonade?\nLemonade is not the same beverage everywhere in the world. In Britain and some other countries, ""lemonade"" refers to a carbonated, clear drink flavored with lemons. It is not as sweet or tart as the typical lemonade made in America from lemon juice, sugar, and water. By many accounts, English lemonade is most similar to lemon-lime sodas in the U.S. For a better substitute than the syrupy big-name commercial brands, look for lemon-flavored soda from boutique soda makers.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Pimm\'s cup is just as refreshing when made with still lemonade. Or, as an alternative to soda, you can give the drink a little fizz in a number of ways:\nUse a store-bought sparkling lemonade or carbonate still lemonade using a soda machine.\nWhile mixing fresh-squeezed lemonade, use sparkling water (seltzer or club soda) to replace all or a portion (about half) of the lemonade\'s water. Only go this route if you\'ll drink all of the lemonade before it goes flat.\nAdd a splash of sparkling water or any clear soda to the drink in the glass. Even tonic water will do because the original Pimm\'s No. 1 is reported to have included quinine.\nMake a Pimm\'s Rangoon by topping the drink off with ginger ale (some people enjoy the snappy spice of ginger beer).\nFor a Pimm\'s Royal, top the drink with Champagne.\nHow Strong Is the Pimm\'s Cup?\nThe Pimm\'s cup is not a strong drink. In fact, it\'s quite light and has an alcohol content right around 6 percent ABV (12 proof). That\'s about the same as the average beer, so feel free to have a second round.\nWhen was Pimm\'s created?\nThe Pimm\'s story began in 1840 with James Pimm at his Oyster Bar in London. As was customary at the time, he created his own liqueurs and called each of his secret recipes a ""house cup."" Rather than giving each liqueur a unique name, Pimm numbered the cups, and they quickly became famous. Pimm sold the bar to Sir Horatio David Davies in 1870, and before the turn of the century, the liqueurs were bottled and sold outside the bar. The brand was purchased by Diageo in 1969 and remains in the liquor company\'s portfolio.\nWhat kind of liquor is Pimm\'s?\nPimm\'s is the familiar name for a liqueur that was formally known as Pimm\'s Cup No. 1 (the company has dropped ""Cup"" from the name). It is a gin-based liqueur with a deep red color that is flavored with herbal botanicals, spices, and caramelized orange. The exact ingredients are proprietary and strictly guarded by the brand. It is bottled at 25 percent ABV (50 proof). Pimm\'s is a digestif and enjoyable when drunk straight after a meal, though the lemonade mix is the preferred way to serve this liqueur.\nWhat were the other Pimm\'s liqueurs?\nOver the years, there have been a total of six bottled Pimm\'s recipes. Each began with a different base liquor and used various herbs, fruits, and spices to create unique flavors. Pimm\'s fell out of the limelight around the 1970s and dramatic changes have been made to the brand\'s portfolio. Today, The Pimm\'s Company produces only the gin and vodka liqueurs (and occasionally the brandy).\nPimm\'s No. 2: A Scotch whisky base, this liqueur was discontinued in the 1970s.\nPimm\'s No. 3: The brandy-based liqueur includes cinnamon, caramel, and orange. It was pulled from the market for a few decades but made a comeback in 2004 as Winter Cup. It continues to come and go and is best found in the U.K. when it is available. This 50-proof liqueur is excellent when topped with ginger ale.\nPimm\'s No. 4: The rum-based liqueur was discontinued in the \'70s.\nPimm\'s No. 5: Rye whiskey was the base for this liqueur that was discontinued in the brand\'s \'70s purge.\nPimm\'s No. 6: The vodka-based liqueur was not in Pimm\'s original bar. It was launched in 1964, discontinued for a while, then brought back due to popular demand. It also goes by the name ""Vodka Cup."" For a time, there was a rendition of it flavored with blackberry and elderflower. Try it in the Pimm\'s cup cocktail, mix it with sparkling ros? wine, or blend it into a fros?.\nGarden Fresh, This \'Cup\' Cocktail Begins With Cucumber Vodka']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pimms-no-1-cup-recipe-759329

Muddle well.\nAdd equal parts of bourbon and ginger ale.\nStir gently.\nFill the glass with ice, serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nMake this drink taller by building it in a highball glass. In this case, pouring equal parts of bourbon and soda would be too much whiskey. Instead, try it with at least 4 ounces of ginger ale and extra ice.\nSwitch to another light soda. Lemon-lime sodas will ramp up the citrus, while club soda creates a drink that's not quite as sweet. Tonic water is an excellent choice for a drier drink, especially with dinner.\nUse this cocktail for other liquors. It's an excellent mixed drink for rum, tequila, and vodka, and you can switch to lemon or lime for an equally refreshing combo.\nWhat Food Complements Whiskey?\nBourbon, and whiskey in general, is an excellent choice for food and drink pairings, including most grilled foods. Beef and pork dishes are perfect complements to whiskey, and smoked salmon is another top choice. Don't rule out grilled chicken or seafood for whiskey cocktails, either. You can't beat the delicious combination of chocolate and whiskey for dessert, and both are a good match for the orange found in the summer breeze cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Summer Breeze Cocktail?\nThe alcohol content of the summer breeze is average for mixed drinks. When made according to the recipe as a short drink, it's pretty strong at about 19 percent ABV (38 proof). The highball version with twice the soda is more like a glass of wine, at 13 percent ABV (26 proof).\n25 Best Blended Cocktails to Enjoy This Summer""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/summer-breeze-cocktail-recipe-759380

A full ounce may be a little much, depending on the whiskey or brandy you pour. Start out with just 1/2 ounce of syrup, stir it up, give it a taste, then add more if needed.\nUse whatever fruits are in season at the moment, just as they would have in the late 1800s before modern distribution made a bounty of fruits available year-round. If you prefer to keep it simple, a cherry and a slice each of lemon and orange are great any time of year.\nSome cobbler recipes top the drink with club soda. This is a fine option, though it's not traditional or required.\nCobblers really are best when served over crushed ice. To quickly crush ice cubes, place them in a plastic or cloth bag (a Lewis bag is specifically made for this task) and hit it with your muddler or a rolling pin. You can also use a blender but will want to remove any excess water it creates.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile brandy and whiskey both make a great cobbler, gin and rum are also acceptable options when it comes to the base spirit.\nYou can use any distilled spirit as the base. For instance, you might try a Grand Marnier cobbler or a pear brandy cobbler. Many of these include sherry along with the other spirit.\nFor an old-fashioned twist, try substituting the simple syrup for gomme syrup. It will give your drink a silkier texture that is quite enjoyable.\nHow Strong Is a Brandy Cobbler?\nSince the cobbler is predominantly liquor, this is not going to be a light drink. When made with an 80-proof brandy or whiskey and no club soda, it has an alcohol content around 27 percent ABV (54 proof). That's about the same as a Manhattan or metropolitan. Of course, if you add soda, it will weaken the drink and if you go with the full 4-ounce pour Jerry Thomas used, it will be even stronger.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-or-whiskey-cobbler-759391

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe was created by Pisco Port?n, so it naturally recommends that brand. You can use any pisco, just make sure that your substitute is a premium quality brandy.\nAdding both citrus garnishes really does make this drink stand out. However, they\'re not necessary, so if you have only one of the fruits, use that garnish alone.\nBe sure to serve the autumn leaves in a chilled cocktail glass so the drink stays cool and fresh while you enjoy it. The quickest way to do it is to place a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix the drink. Dump the ice before straining.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you wanted to substitute another brandy for the pisco, it would be best to choose Armagnac, Cognac, or Brandy de Jerez as they are also distilled from actual wine (fermented grape juice) rather than the leftovers from wine production. You will notice a difference between these options and pisco, however, because pisco is typically not aged. It does not have the oak undertones common to the other styles of brandy.\nGrappa and other brandies would make a decent substitute as well. Again, neither of these have quite the same taste as pisco from Peru or Chile.\nHow Strong Is an Autumn Leaves Cocktail?\nWhenever you see a short drink made primarily of liquor, you can expect it to be strong and full of flavor. That\'s certainly true for the autumn leaves cocktail, which will weigh in with an alcohol content around 29 percent ABV (58 proof). It\'s almost as strong as the average gin martini and one too many will add up rather quickly.\nThere is another popular cocktail that takes on the ""autumn leaves"" name. It\'s more of a twist on the Manhattan and pairs rye whiskey, apple brandy, sweet vermouth, and Strega with a custom cinnamon tincture. This autumn leaves recipe was created by Jeffrey Morgenthaler in 2008 and the bartender and cocktail book author has the recipe on his website, JeffreyMorgenthaler.com.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/autumn-leaves-cocktail-recipe-759388

It takes some force to break it up, so shake it like you mean it!\nThe key to safely drinking cocktails with eggs is to ensure your egg is fresh. There's a quick test that you should every time before you add an egg to the shaker: Fill a glass with water and place the egg inside. If it sinks, your egg is good; eggs that float to the top are too old, even for cooking, and should be discarded.\nServing the nightcap in a chilled glass definitely makes a difference. If you forgot to pre-chill it, place a few ice cubes and cold soda water (optional, but helpful) in the glass while you mix the drink. Dump it out before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nAnisette is called for in the original recipe, though that's not a common liqueur in many of today's bars. You can use any of the other anise-flavored liqueurs such as absinthe, Herbsaint, or sambuca in its place.\nAnise is a strong flavor, so you may want to back off on that ingredient a little. Try it with just 1/4 ounce to 1/2 ounce of the liqueur instead.\nThe egg yolk does add an eggy flavor to cocktails?similar to eggnog?though an egg white does not. Try the nightcap with just an egg white instead and you'll get a drink with a luscious texture and foam on top with a barely indistinguishable egg taste.\nYou can also skip the egg entirely.\nHow Strong Is a Nightcap Cocktail?\nBesides being sweeter, anisette is nearly half the strength of spirits like absinthe. If you stick with the anisette (or another liqueur in the 30 proof range), the nightcap shakes up to 20 percent ABV (40 proof). That's half the strength of the brandy, so it's a potent little cocktail.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/night-cap-cocktail-recipe-759404

You can also upgrade or downgrade within the brand as you see fit. All three companies produce a full range of Cognac, using the standard brandy ratings: Very Special (VS), Very Superior Old Pale (VSOP), and Extra Old (XO). The abbreviations are listed in order of age and, therefore, price. Use this little bit of knowledge when choosing your sipping and cocktail Cognacs:\nCourvoisier VSOP: A very fine Cognac at a reasonable price, this bottling from Courvoisier is a fantastic find, and its peachy spice is nice against the amaretto. If using it, consider skipping the ice and simply enjoy a straight pour of the two spirits.\nCamus VSOP: Cognac fans know this name. This bottling has wonderful character and a fruity oak that is perfect for the French Connection.\nHennessy VS: This is a perfect choice for any Cognac cocktail. It is worth every penny and considered by many to be the best budget-friendly Cognac around.\nOther French Connection-Inspired Drinks\nWhile the recipe above may be one of the best known, there's no reason to pass either of these up when you have Cognac in the bar:\nFrench Connection No. 2: Also known as The Beautiful, simply replace the amaretto with Grand Marnier, an orange-flavored liquor with hints of vanilla and oak.\nFrench Connection Coffee: Also called Caf? Amore, this spiced coffee with Cognac and amaretto is a nice option for dessert, especially if topped with whipped cream and almonds.\nHow Strong Is the French Connection?\nThere is very little dilution in the French Connection, especially since some drinkers prefer not to include ice. That means this brandy drink is just slightly below bottling strength, averaging about 30 percent ABV (60 proof) per serving. Drinks like this and the famous B?n?dictine and brandy (B&B) are meant to show off some of the best brandies in the world, and the higher proof means that there is more flavor to enjoy. Sip this one straight as it was meant to be and savor it slowly.\nWhat is the difference between the French Connection vs. Godfather?\nBoth of these drinks?the French Connection and the Godfather?were named for famous films, and both use equal parts of amaretto. The difference between these two is the French Connection uses Cognac, while the Godfather uses whiskey as the base spirit.\nDigestifs Are the Ideal Drinks to Finish Off a Great Meal""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/french-connection-cocktail-recipes-759434

Put extra effort into the shake, even going until your arms hurt.\nGive the egg a quick freshness test before cracking it: Place it in a glass of water and if it sinks, it\'s good. Whenever your egg stands on end, it\'s best reserved for food in which it will be cooked. Floating eggs should be discarded.\nLarge eggs are the most common today, though this recipe is sized for a small egg. If you find that it\'s too eggy with a large egg, your easiest option is to increase the brandy and port to 2 ounces each. This will create one large cocktail or two smaller ones.\nIf you like, rim the glass with a mixture of brown sugar and nutmeg to make the drink extra special.\nHow Strong Is a Coffee Cocktail?\nThe egg brings the coffee cocktail down to a comfortable alcohol content for most people. This recipe should fall into the 17 percent ABV (34 proof) range, which is typical of this style of drink.\nRecipe Variations\nVery similar to the coffee cocktail, the porto flip uses the same ingredients but changes up the way they are used. This recipe focuses on the port and leaves the brandy as an accent. The porto flip is a common ""flip"" drink, which were once very popular but lost some of their appeal in the late 19th Century.\nTo make the drink, shake 1/4 ounce brandy, 1 1/2 ounces ruby port, and 1 egg yolk thoroughly and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.

Its alcohol content should fall in the 22 percent ABV (44 proof) range.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are variations on the brandy daisy itself and a variety of daisy drinks made with other liquors. Explore all of them to see which you enjoy most.\nToday, the brandy daisy often features Yellow Chartreuse and is either simple or very complex. One of the easiest (and most delightful) recipes simply shakes 1 1/2 ounces of brandy with 3/4 ounce each of Yellow Chartreuse and lemon juice. It\'s topped with a splash of soda.\nSometimes the daisies are served tall over fresh ice in a collins glass then enough soda is added to fill the glass.\nThe gin daisy often uses a sweeter gin, such as Old Tom or genever. The classic version mixes 2 ounces of gin, and 3/4 ounce each of lemon juice and orange liqueur (sometimes maraschino), and tops off a collins glass with soda. The modern version of this is fruitier, using 1/4 ounce each of grenadine and simple syrup rather than an orange liqueur.\nThe classic rum daisy pours a full 2 ounces of rum, 1/2 ounce of cura?ao, 1 teaspoon of simple syrup, and the juice of half a lemon. A modern version skips the cura?ao and opts for 1 teaspoon each of simple syrup and grenadine. Neither of these generally include soda, though it\'s not a bad addition.\nAll of the classic elements are found in the average whiskey daisy recipe as well. These tend to prefer Grand Marnier for the orange liqueur, though some skip the liqueur entirely and use orgeat syrup instead.\nThere is even a tequila daisy but you probably know it as the margarita (translates from Spanish to ""daisy""). It skips the soda and uses lime.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-daisy-cocktail-recipe-759414

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThough cognac is recommended, any style of brandy will make a fine caf? amore. You can even save a little money and pour a mid-range brandy because the drink's flavors are so strong that you won't notice the difference.\nThis drink will be best with the richest, darkest cup of coffee you have the capability to brew. You'll see a drastic improvement when you skip the drip brewer and choose alternative brewing methods like a French press or pour-over brewer.\nIf you want to get crafty in the bar, make your own amaretto. The easiest homemade amaretto recipe is made with white and brown sugars, vodka, and almond and vanilla extracts. It can be ready within one hour, so it's a great last-minute project.\nRecipe Variations\nTypically, the caf? amore uses equal parts (1 ounce each) of the two liquors, while the French connection coffee has 1 1/2 ounces cognac and 1/2 ounce amaretto.\nIt's also a delightful drink when made with iced coffee. Try it with coffee-flavored ice cubes so it doesn't get diluted with water. To make them, simply freeze fresh-brewed coffee in your ice cube tray. You could also combine coffee and Irish cream in the cubes.\nAlso on the cooler side, you can skip the coffee and make a French Connection No. 1 cocktail. It combines cognac and amaretto over ice in an old-fashioned glass.\nSwitching from brandy to rum creates a delicious cocktail called the caf? Caribbean.\nIf you're in the mood for whiskey, pour a shot of that instead of brandy. From bourbon to Irish whiskey, almost any style will be a nice pairing for the amaretto.\nHow Strong Is a Caf? Amore?\nIt's possible that the caf? amore has more of a caffeine kick than alcohol. It's a very gentle mixed drink that should weigh in somewhere around 8 percent ABV (16 proof) when made with an 80-proof brandy.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cafe-amore-cocktail-recipe-759418

If you use the liqueur\'s green version, it will taste the same but look a little messier.\nCayenne pepper should not be confused with chili powder. Ground cayenne is up to eight times spicier and chili powder is a blend of spices with a hint of cayenne, so they\'re two entirely different ingredients. Cayenne works in this recipe and, as an alternative, you can use chile powder (note the ""e"") as it\'s a blend of different kinds of chile peppers.\nThis is a very uniquely flavored brandy cocktail, so it\'s really not essential to pour your best brandy. At first, try it with a mid-range option and if you like it, consider mixing it up with the good stuff.\nUntil you learn whether you love or hate this drink, serve it with a water back (a separate glass of water). Consider it a safety net just in case it gets too hot or the mint-pepper combo is too much for you.\nHow Strong Is a Devil Cocktail?\nAnytime you see a cocktail made entirely of liquor, you can expect it to be rather strong.

Include the egg white and vanilla extract if you like.\nShake well (if you choose to add egg, shake until it hurts).\nStrain into an old-fashioned glass with or without crushed ice.\nDust with grated nutmeg for a garnish. Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nMany fans of this drink prefer a good cognac and it\'s really nice when paired with an aged rum. Feel free to experiment with other pairings of the two spirits or simply pour your favorite brandy alone.\nYou can vary the milk that you use in the brandy milk punch. Make it creamier by using half-and-half or even heavy cream. For a lighter choice, use nonfat or 1 percent milk.\nYou can either buy or make your own simple syrup. It is two parts sugar to one part water, brought to a boil and simmered for 10 to 15 minutes. The homemade version is not only incredibly easy, but it can also save you money.\nAdding an egg white to any cocktail comes with the precaution that you want to ensure your egg is fresh. This reduces the risk of illnesses such as salmonella. If you have any concerns, skip the ingredient.\nRecipe Variations\nOften, you will see recipes that call for 2 ounces of milk and 2 ounces of half-and-half or heavy cream for a single serving.\nIf you don\'t tolerate milk products well, you can switch the milk for alternatives such as soy milk or almond milk. As some of these are sweetened, you might want to adjust the amount of simple syrup you add.\nIt is interesting to note that the larger milk punch servings are completely different and may not be to modern taste. According to David Wondrich in the book, ""Imbibe,"" in the actual ""punch"" version the milk was meant to curdle (this was strained off), which is appropriate considering how long the drink sat before drinking.\nHow Strong Is a Brandy Milk Punch?\nThe brandy milk punch is a relaxing and relatively low-proof drink. When you skip the egg white and keep the rum, its alcohol content should be in the 15 percent ABV range. It\'s very similar to drinking a glass of wine, only this drink is far more soothing.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-milk-punch-recipe-759447

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a shot glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nCr?me de cacao is a sweet chocolate-flavored liqueur. The white version?it's actually clear?is recommended for the snowball, but you can use dark cr?me de cacao if you have it. Only the color of the shot will change and the taste will remain the same.\nThere are other chocolate liqueurs available, though most of them are on the creamier side of the spectrum. If you have one of those bottles, it will work in the snowball though you'll have a different texture.\nSome bottles of peppermint schnapps are stronger than others. The higher the proof the stronger the peppermint and alcohol taste will be. If you're using a 100-proof schnapps like Rumple Minze, you might want to pour a little less so you can taste the other ingredients.\nThere's no need to pour your best brandy in this shot. Find a good, affordable brand to keep in your bar for drinks like this and save the good stuff for sipping straight or enjoying in fancy brandy cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you were to skip the brandy and pour only the cr?me de cacao and peppermint schnapps, you would have a polar bear shot.\nAs with that recipe, you can add any base spirit you like to the chocolate-mint combination. Vodka, whiskey, and brandy would be the obvious choices, though an aged tequila may not be bad either.\nAnother similar shot is the snowshoe. In that recipe, you'll simply shake bourbon and peppermint schnapps.\nA fun experiment is to infuse your brandy with chocolate. It's easy to do with chocolate-covered cacao beans, similar to this rye whiskey infusion. Pouring that into your snowball should be pretty tasty and it's a good three-day winter project.\nHow Strong Is the Snowball?\nThe snowball can be either a relatively mild shot or a pretty fierce one. The biggest factor is the peppermint schnapps that you choose to pour.\nWith a 30-proof schnapps, the alcohol content will be around 28 percent ABV (56 proof). If you go with a 100-proof schnapps, it jumps to 41 percent ABV (82 proof) on average.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nA quality gin is going to make a better English rose cocktail. Despite all the extra flavors, pour the same gin as you would any other martini and you'll have a great foundation.\nFor the vermouth, the most important thing to remember is that an open bottle will become stale after a couple of months. You'll notice the flavor begin to diminish, which means it's time to pick up a replacement.\nApricot brandy will either be a sweetened liqueur or a true eau-de-vie (unsweetened and distilled from the fruit). The liqueur version is good in this recipe because it acts as a sweetener, though you may find that just a dash of grenadine is needed for balance.\nFresh lemon juice is the final key to making a spectacular English rose. You can typically expect to get 1 3/4 ounces out of a single lemon, which is more than enough for a few cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a few classic drinks that pair gin and apricot brandy. If you enjoy the English rose, they're definitely worth trying.\nA very similar recipe to this, the Thanksgiving cocktail keeps everything except the grenadine and changes up the proportions so no single ingredient dominates the drink.\nThe paradise recipe simply mixes the gin-apricot brandy duo with orange juice, creating a really bright, fruity martini.\nLa Habana prefers lime over lemon.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with any sour drink, this one will taste better with fresh-squeezed citrus juices.\nRather than squeezing half a lime or lemon into your shaker, take the time to measure them out. Maintaining that balance requires precision and juice yields vary from one fruit to the next.\nRecipe Variations\nAs is typical with classic drinks, there are many slight variations on this recipe. The taste is essentially the same, but the overall character is often accented by one element. Some of these may work better with certain whiskeys, too.\nIf you want to give the drink a boost, pour up to 3/4 ounce of lemon juice, keeping the other ingredients the same as the recipe.\nTo make the Frisco sour slightly sweeter, bump the Benedictine up to 3/4 ounce.\nSome recipes skip the lime juice, opting for lemon alone. The pour remains at 1/2 ounce.\nYou will find recipes that use the lemon juice alone, add 1/4 ounce of simple syrup, and an egg white. The addition of egg is an old sour drink favorite. You won't get an eggy flavor from the white but will get a different mouthfeel and a luscious foamy top on the drink.\nThere's also the Frisco cocktail, though its recipe is not easily agreed upon either. Typically, you'll be making a Frisco when you skip the citrus juices. Instead, pour a shot of whiskey with a little (up to 1/2 ounce) Benedictine then garnish it with a lemon twist.\nHow Strong Is a Frisco Sour?\nThe long shot of whiskey ramps up the Frisco sour's flavor as well as its alcohol content. If you pour the average 80-proof whiskey it mixes up to 25 percent ABV (50 proof).

Or shake the liqueurs up and strain them into a frosty shot glass.\nIf you want an extra kick, add Irish whiskey. Keep the three ingredients equal by pouring 1/2 ounce of each. Shake with ice and strain into a shot glass.\nYet another fun option is to serve the Nutty Irishman in a cocktail glass. Any of the variations can work out well?even the layered one?and it makes an excellent dessert cocktail.\nIf you enjoy a White Russian, skip the coffee liqueur and pour Frangelico instead. Simply pour about 1 ounce each of Irish cream, Frangelico, and cream into a cocktail shaker. Shake well and strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice (or skip ice if serving in a chilled glass). You can also build the drink directly in the serving glass and give it a good stir.\nFor the cream, half-and-half is one of the best options because it is neither too thick nor too light. If you want a thicker drink, go with heavy cream. For a lighter drink, light cream or even whole milk will do.\nSkip the extra cream and pour a shot of whiskey or vodka instead. Keep the Frangelico and Irish cream and serve it on the rocks. Irish whiskey is a natural choice that's preferred for the Nutty Irishman. For an interesting twist, you can also try an espresso vodka.\nThe flavors of the nutty Irishman are perfect for creating a hot coffee cocktail. One of the best recipes combines a full 1 1/2-ounce shot of Irish whiskey with 1 ounce each of Irish cream and Frangelico. Top that with as much coffee as you like or go with a freshly pulled double shot of espresso.\nTips\nFrangelico, a hazelnut liqueur, is the most popular nut-flavored liqueur on the market and a great addition to any bar. There are other hazelnut liqueurs available, so feel free to pour any you find as a substitute.\nIrish cream is also essential in the modern bar, and there are some great brands available. Baileys is the most popular, though you might want to try others like Carolans or Molly's as well. RumChata is another great cream liqueur substitute.\nHow Strong Is a Nutty Irishman?\nThe strength of your Nutty Irishman depends on how you choose to make it. For instance, the layered shot has no dilution, so it's pretty strong at 20 percent ABV (40 proof). Adding cream and diluting it with ice for a lowball drops that down to 11 percent ABV (22 proof), while adding a shot of vodka or whiskey to that is equivalent to the layered shot. The hot coffee version will be somewhere around 18 percent ABV (36 proof).\nWhat Is the Best Way to Drink Frangelico?\nThe hazelnut liqueur can be enjoyed served on the rocks for a sweet, nutty after-dinner sip or mixed with soda. Because of its nutty flavor, Frangelico pairs nicely with coffee and espresso, dairy (like cream or milk), and cream liqueurs like Bailey's. It can also make a nice pairing with hard liquor like whiskey, which has nutty aspects, or neutral vodka.\nFun Baileys Cocktail and Shot Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/4-recipes-for-the-popular-nutty-irishman-drink-759747

Even though Frangelico has a heavier flavor, it will not cover up a vodka\'s impurities. Your best bet is to save the cheaper vodkas for drinks like the white Russian and pour the good stuff into this cocktail.\n\nThe great news is that even top-shelf vodka remains relatively affordable and there are many fantastic brands to explore. Consider popular brands like Chopin or Ketel One for reliable, easy-to-find options that will make nearly any martini you want to mix up taste great.\n\nYou can also use this recipe to test out American-made craft vodkas like the potato-based Blue Ice, Zodiac, or Cold River, or Washington\'s Dry Fly wheat. Each vodka will give the drink its own unique twist and leave you rethinking the spirit\'s ""flavorless"" reputation.\nHow Strong Is a Nutty Martini?\nThe majority of martinis are very strong drinks, a fact that their fancy presentation often hides. This recipe is no exception and you can expect your nutty martini\'s alcohol content to fall somewhere around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).\nRecipe Variations\nFor an authentic nutty martini, Frangelico is the brand of choice. It is one of the essential spirits for a well-stocked bar and is arguably the best hazelnut liqueur available. However, it\'s not your only option and a bottle can be a little pricey.\nThere are some budget-friendly options, including Hiram Walker and DeKuyper, both of which are relatively easy to find and at least half the price. If you look hard enough, you can also find interesting bottles from Bartenura, Davinia, Francesca, and Kahlua. The price ranges of these vary and any unknown bottle is definitely worth picking up to see if you enjoy it.\nIf you like to experiment, you can also make your own liqueur. It\'s not much different from the walnut-based nocino recipe, you\'ll simply use raw hazelnuts and add extra flavors as you see fit. To replicate the taste of Frangelico, adding coffee, vanilla bean, and cocoa nibs to the infusion would be a good place to begin. You can also play with the base spirits; a combination of vodka and brandy form a solid foundation for the nutty flavor.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/nutty-martini-recipe-759750

Try it with a bold Navy rum, gold or aged rums, or spiced rum to see which you enjoy most.\nLikewise, fans of this cocktail often have a preference on the grapefruit juice. Experiment with white, pink, or ruby red grapefruit juice.\nFresh citrus juices will definitely make a better cocktail. Grapefruits yield a lot of juice (about 5 or 6 ounces), so a single fruit is perfect for a few drinks. For the lime juice, you can make it easy by simply squeezing the juice from one lime into the shaker.\nThere are options for the sugar too! Superfine sugar is often preferred, though you'll often see the suggestion to use powdered sugar in this recipe. To avoid worries about diluting granulated sugar, use 1/2 ounce of simple syrup instead.\nThe bitters are open for interpretation though aromatic bitters (e.g., Angostura) is most common. Play with some of the newer flavors, including grapefruit, lemon, peach, or rhubarb for a fun twist.\nThis is a fantastic drink to serve on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass as well.\nRecipe Variations\nOne popular variation pours 2 ounces of rum, 1 ounce of grapefruit juice, then 1/2 ounce each of lime juice and simple syrup (no bitters).\nAnother one is heavier on the lime, mixing 1 1/2 ounces each of rum and lime juice, 1 ounce of grapefruit juice, 3 teaspoons powdered sugar, and bitters.\nHow Strong Is a Nevada Cocktail?\nFor a martini-style of drink, the Nevada cocktail is one of the lightest you will find.

Ice cubes work just fine, too.\nYou can use your blender to quickly crush ice; just be sure to strain off any extra water before adding it to the shaker. A better option is to place ice cubes in a lint-free towel or cloth bag (a Lewis bag is designed for this purpose) and whack them with a rolling pin, muddler, or mallet. It is even noisier but can also be wonderful stress relief.\nFor the triple sec, select a premium brand or switch to a top-shelf orange cura?ao. There are many inexpensive bottles of orange liqueur available, though these can ruin a drink, especially when it's the featured ingredient as it is in this martini.\nBe sure to chill your cocktail glasses in the refrigerator or freezer. You can also give them a quick chill by filling each glass with crushed ice while you're mixing the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch to a premium citrus-flavored vodka to enhance the orange even more.\nIf you want to go sweeter (or simply make the drink more festive), rim the glass with sugar and finely grated orange zest.\nHow Strong Is the Orange Martini?\nThis beautiful cocktail should not be underestimated.

Of course, this will not add any dilution which helps marry the strong flavors. It will also produce a much stronger drink.\nRecipe Variations\nOne popular version of this shot (commonly called liquid cocaine no. 2) takes a much different approach: Pour 1/4 ounce each of orange liqueur, peach schnapps or Southern Comfort, vodka, and amaretto into a cocktail shaker filled with ice. Add a splash of pineapple juice and cranberry juice and shake well. Strain into a shot glass.\nThat vodka shot is also mixed up as a highball. To make it, increase all of the liquors to 1/2-ounce pours and add 3 ounces each of pineapple and cranberry juices. Shake and serve on the rocks with a splash of lemon-lime soda.\nAnother version of the shot skips the cinnamon schnapps and pours rum instead: Shake 1/2-ounce each of rum, J?germeister, and Rumple Minze with ice and strain into a shot glass.\nThe firecracker is a fun twist on the shot: Pour 1/2-ounce each of tequila, Goldschl?ger, and Rumple Minze into a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake and strain into a shot glass. While you could use different brands of schnapps, the two suggested serve a purpose: Goldschl?ger adds beautiful gold flakes that simulate a blown firecracker and Rumple Minze adds its intense, 100-proof peppermint taste.\nHow Strong Is the Cold-Stone Stinger?\nEven though they're meant for a party and a good time, it's best to remain aware that any of these shots are very strong. The alcohol content will depend on which liquors you pour in the various combinations. When shaken with ice, the average falls in the 30 percent ABV (60 proof) range or the same strength as a gin martini. If you choose to skip the ice, this shot can easily reach 50 percent ABV (100 proof) or higher, especially when made with high-proof spirits. To put that in perspective, a straight tequila or whiskey shot is 80 proof. Take it easy with these and, please, drink responsibly.\n\nWhy Was It Called the Liquid Cocaine?\nThe liquid cocaine shots were most popular during the last few decades of the 20th century when drink names were often off-color. Not only are the flavors intense, but they are designed to be extremely powerful and mimic the effects of the drug they're named for. The versions shared here are not even the strongest. One dangerous mix that should be avoided includes Everclear. There is a high risk of alcohol poisoning and, quite frankly, the 151-proof (or higher) neutral grain alcohol does not taste good in drinks.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/liquid-cocaine-and-firecracker-shots-759724

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf the mix is too thick once blended, add a little more orange or lime juice and blend it again. If it's too thin, add more ice or sherbet.\nOne-half cup of ice is about three or four ice cubes.\nFrozen margaritas do not require the best tequila in your bar. You do want to choose one that you wouldn't mind sipping straight or shooting in order to get the best cocktail, though.\nTriple sec is the customary orange liqueur for margaritas, but it's not your only option. Try this drink with Patron Citronge (a tequila-based liqueur), cura?ao, or Grand Marnier. Just make sure your liqueur matches the quality of the tequila you pour as many of the cheapest options can be very syrupy.\nRecipe Variations\nNo sherbet? Make an orange margarita with orange juice instead. Pour between 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce of orange juice into the blender and increase the ice to 1 cup, keeping the other ingredients the same.\nAnother option is to shake up a bloody margarita featuring blood orange juice. The darker variety of the citrus fruit is slightly sweeter than navel oranges, creating a familiar but unique cocktail. You can also use that recipe to make a shaken margarita with regular orange juice.\nAdd some spice to the mix with the habanero blood orange margarita recipe. It features a homemade puree of blood orange juice and habanero pepper and rims the glass with mole negro.\nBring in another dimension of flavor that complements the orange. Do so with about some chopped fruit or 1/2 ounce of a flavored simple syrup, liqueur, or juice. Good options include banana, berries, chocolate, ginger, pineapple, and vanilla.\nHow Strong Is an Orange Margarita?\nThe orange margarita is about as gentle as most frozen cocktails. Once blended, its alcohol content should be somewhere in the 11 percent ABV (22 proof) range.

It follows suit with the likes of other whiskey 'up' drinks like the Manhattan, though the mixers in this recipe do help tame it down a bit. If you pour an 80-proof whiskey, your New York Cocktail will be somewhere around 21 percent ABV (42 proof).\nChoose Your Whiskey\nOpting for a bottle of Canadian whiskey is often a good idea because they are masters at blending. Rye whiskey and even a mellow bourbon would work as well. Different whiskeys may call for slight adjustments to the drink's sweeteners. If the whiskey you choose is sweet (or you simply wish to cut out the added sugar), you can skip the sugar completely. The grenadine does a great job of sweetening the drink on its own.\nWhen Should a Cocktail Be Shaken?\nThe general rule for when to shake a cocktail depends on its ingredients. If the drink includes simple syrup, citrus or sour mix, egg whites, cream liqueurs, fruit juices, or dairy, it should be prepared in a shaker versus simply stirred in a pitcher. The shaking ensures that all of the ingredients are well mixed, and if there is any dairy that is does not separate.

That's because an exciting change came to Southern Comfort (popularly called SoCo) in 2017. After the brand was purchased by the Sazerac Company from Brown-Forman in May of that year, the formula changed and whiskey is back.\nThat's right, if you thought you were drinking flavored whiskey all these years, you'd be mistaken and you're not alone. The SoCo base has long been a neutral grain spirit?similar to many vodkas?and this topic has spurred countless bar debates over the years. \nThough the exact SoCo recipe is still a secret, Sazerac has assured loyal fans that it does include a selection of their North American whiskey. It's now truer to the original 1874 recipe created by New Orleans' M.W. Heron who founded the brand. This is excellent news for fans of the purple viking and other SoCo cocktails like the Scarlett O'Hara.\nYou also have more options on the liquor shelf: Southern Comfort Original is 35 percent ABV (70 proof) and there is an 80-proof black label version as well as a 100-proof bottling. All have a distinct whiskey base with those signature fruits and spices that made the brand such a hit over the years. It's definitely a great time to rediscover this iconic brand, even if you were turned off by it in the past.\nHow Strong Is the Purple Viking Cocktail?\nFour spirits are poured into the purple viking and they make up the majority of the drink, so this isn't the weakest drink you can mix up. However, each of the liquors is around 30 percent ABV and that helps bring down the alcohol content a bit (unless you choose the 100-proof SoCo).\n\nWhen mixing the 70-proof Southern Comfort into a 6-ounce drink, the purple viking comes in around 20 percent ABV (40 proof). It's one of the stronger tall drinks you can make, but it's not too potent.

The flavor will remain the same, though the shot's color will be slightly different.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a peppermint patty, all you really need is a chocolate ingredient and a mint ingredient. Use cr?me de menthe instead of peppermint schnapps, or pour another chocolate liqueur.\nSwitch to another cream liqueur or use dairy cream or your favorite milk. You can also skip the cream completely and combine 1 ounce each of the chocolate and mint liqueurs.\nAnother peppermint patty makes use of chocolate vodka: Shake 1 ounce of chocolate vodka, 1/2 ounce each of Irish cream and peppermint schnapps with ice?strain into a shot glass.\nOne version is an interactive shot and more of a boozy mouthwash (similar to a cement mixer but better tasting): Fill a shot glass with chilled peppermint schnapps, squirt chocolate syrup directly into your mouth, drink the shot of schnapps, and shake your head to mix the flavors before swallowing.\nIf you like the flavor combination, there are other ways to serve a peppermint patty. Try one of the slow and refreshing peppermint patty lowball recipes, or warm things up with a hot peppermint patty.\nHow Strong Is a Peppermint Patty Shooter?\nFor the most part, this shot uses low-proof liqueurs, but your choice of peppermint schnapps can make a big difference. Some schnapps is just 30 proof, while others?like Rumple Minze?are a whopping 100 proof. A peppermint patty made with the lighter option will be around 16 percent ABV (32 proof). Pouring Rumple Minze creates a shot that's 31 percent ABV (62 proof).\nWhat liquor goes with peppermint schnapps?\nPeppermint schnapps makes an appearance in many drink recipes, and it's most often paired with a chocolate liqueur. Vodka and whiskey are the best liquors for the mint-chocolate flavor and can give this shot a nice kick. Brandy works surprisingly well; pour that without the cream, and you'll have a snowball shooter.\nHow long does peppermint schnapps last?\nLike all liquors, peppermint schnapps has a very long shelf life. Most?particularly the higher-proof brands?will last for years after the bottle is open. Store it in a cool place out of sunlight and make sure the bottle is sealed. When exposed to air, heat, or too much light, it may begin to lose some flavor but remain safe to drink.

That works best if all ingredients are chilled beforehand.\nFor the orange liqueur, choose a premium brand that matches the quality of Pama. Any of the main styles will work out just fine, including orange cura?ao, triple sec, and brandy-based options like Grand Marnier.\nTrue French Champagne is not required. Instead, you can use any sparkling wine; Prosecco and Cava are good budget-friendly options.\nFresh-squeezed orange juice will make a better pomegranate poinsettia. The average orange yields between 2 and 3 ounces of juice, so a single piece of fruit is enough for a few cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nFor quick party service, mix equal parts of the first three ingredients in a large batch and store it in a chilled pitcher. When it's time to serve, simply pour from the pitcher and top each glass with Champagne.\nIf you want to add a garnish, drop a few pomegranate arils (the seeds) into each glass or drape an elegant orange twist over the rim.\nTo knock the cocktail's strength down a notch, pour pomegranate juice rather than the liqueur.\nYou can also make a nonalcoholic version of the pomegranate poinsettia for guests who don't drink. Simply skip the orange liqueur, pour pomegranate juice, and switch from wine to sparkling grape juice.\nHow Strong Is a Pomegranate Poinsettia?\nSince the majority of this cocktail is made up of Pama and wine, it's a relatively low-proof drink. When using the average 60 proof orange liqueur, it mixes up to just 13 percent ABV (26 proof). That's a similar alcohol content to wine, so you won't have to worry about guests getting drunk off a glass or two.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pomegranate-poinsettia-recipe-759774

This can be done quickly with just a dash of liquid smoke (don\'t overdo it) added to the shaker with the cream and sugar. Or, you can follow the approach of barbecue masters and actually smoke the cream in your backyard smoker. It\'s the secret to making smoked ice cream and other toasted desserts like smoked chocolate ganache.\nHow Strong Is a Pink Elephant?\nThere may be three alcoholic ingredients in this recipe, but they\'re all mild.

This recipe is just as good with old-fashioned recipes made by melting chocolate as it is with a powdered cocoa mix.\nWarming up your glass (or mug) ensures the drink stays warm to that last sip. It's as easy as pouring hot water into the glass while you make the cocoa or heating the water-filled in the microwave for 10 seconds.\nFor the whipped cream, you can go with the freshly whipped variety made from whipping or heavy cream. Lightly whipping it, as seen in the Irish coffee, is all that's needed. Or, take the quick and easy route and use a can of whipped cream.\nRecipe Variations\nThere's really no reason you can't use green cr?me de menthe in the cocoa. It will change the color slightly, but the taste will remain the same and eliminate the need to have two bottles of the mint liqueur.\nA bunch of mini marshmallows is an excellent alternative to the whipped cream.\nGive this cocktail a kick by adding an extra shot of liquor. Brandy is an excellent option and will work very well with the warm mint-chocolate taste.\nHow Strong Is a Midnight Snowstorm?\nMost hot chocolate cocktails are very light because the cocoa outweighs the liquor. The midnight snowstorm follows that pattern and mixes up to just 7 percent ABV (14 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nWhy Isn\'t It Called a Redheaded Slut Anymore?\nFor many years, some of the most popular bar drinks were given names geared toward a ""naughty"" party atmosphere. Some were intended as tongue-in-cheek references to sex or drugs and others were quite lewd and offensive. The redheaded slut falls into that category, and its alternative names were equally insulting. While the drink remains popular and tasty, it\'s time that it follows suit with other drinks from the last few decades of the 20th-century and receive a new name. Updating this drink to ""fuzzy J?ger cranberry"" is our way of joining the conversation for more appropriate cocktail names that anyone can feel good about saying out loud. It also makes it easier to remember: like the fuzzy navel, it includes peach schnapps, and J?germeister and cranberry juice are required.\nTips\nDouble up: The ratio of the three ingredients makes it easy to mix up a full round of shots at once. It\'s also very easy to scale the drink to any size you like. Whatever the volume you are going for, keep the proportions the same: 1 part each of the liqueurs and 2 parts juice.\nSip it up: The mix can quickly be served on the rocks or even ""up"" in a cocktail glass.\nShake it up: The dilution that the shoter gets from the ice during a quick shaking session is essential. Without that little bit of water, the drink can be too syrupy and too sweet. As is the case with many shooters, it can be tempting to skip this step and simply pour everything directly into the shot glass. That may save you a bit of time but will leave you with a super potent, cough syrup-like shooter.\nHow Strong Is the Fuzzy J?ger Cranberry?\nThough this shooter does have a very sweet taste, it can be a deceptive shot. The spirits used here are definitely not low proof, so try to limit yourself to just one or two per night. It is a sneaky drink that will get you drunk before you know it and can cause a nasty hangover. If we were to mix a schnapps such as Peachtree (24 percent ABV) with J?germeister, the average fuzzy J?ger cranberry would weigh in at around 24 percent ABV (48 proof).\n12 Tasty Recipes for J?germeister Cocktails and Shots']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/fuzzy-jager-cranberry-shooter-759787

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you\'re not comfortable with rolling drinks, feel free to stir the raspberry press in an ice-filled highball glass.\nYou can make the drink as tall or short as you like. Simply pour more or less of the two sodas to suit your taste, making sure to keep the proportions equal. A splash of each creates a short, very flavorful drink that\'s actually a better fit for an old-fashioned glass (though that make rolling more difficult). Pouring 2 ounces of each soda is about perfect for a nicely balanced tall drink.\nHow Strong Is a Raspberry Press?\nThe strength of the raspberry press depends on the bottling proof of the vodka and the amount of soda you choose to pour. For instance, with 80-proof vodka and 1 ounce of soda in total, the drink has an alcohol content in the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range. With 4 ounces of soda, it will be much milder at 12 percent ABV (24 proof).\nWhat Is the Vodka Press?\nThe vodka press is a semi-popular mixed drink that remains a little obscure. It certainly isn\'t ordered as often as a vodka tonic or vodka cranberry, but many people enjoy it because it\'s a nice, refreshing drink. \nQuite simply, the vodka press is a shot of vodka with both club soda and lemon-lime soda. It\'s made just like the raspberry press, but with clear vodka. \nThe word ""press"" in the name may seem to indicate that you\'ll be pressing something with a muddler, but that is not the case. Instead, the vodka press takes its name from the popular whiskey highball known as the Presbyterian. It\'s also a double soda drink, though it typically uses ginger ale instead of Sprite or 7-Up.\nRecipe Variations\nIn keeping with the raspberry press theme, you can certainly pour any flavored vodka into your vodka press. The great variety of fruit vodkas available offer nearly endless possibilities and even non-fruit flavors can produce a tasty drink.\nTry a vanilla press made with vanilla vodka. The taste is similar to a vanilla cream soda, but with a drier profile.\nWhy Two Sodas?\nMixed drinks like the Presbyterian and Vodka Press raise the question of why two sodas are poured rather than just one. The answer really comes down to balance. \nClub soda tends to have a dry profile because it\'s unsweetened. The majority of lemon-lime sodas are sweetened and some have more sugar than others. In general, though, they are certainly not as sugary as many colas or sodas like Mountain Dew.\nBy combining the two sodas in one drink, you get a nice hint of citrus and a touch of sweetness with double the carbonation. In the end, it\'s actually brilliant and it is one of the most refreshing soda highballs you can mix up.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-press-cocktail-recipe-759783

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail or margarita glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nBlanco tequila is a great choice for this margarita. However, the slight aging of reposado tequila is a nice background for the darker fruit as well.\nThere are plenty of raspberry liqueur options available. For instance, you can go with the popular black raspberry taste of Chambord, or pick up a bottle of Bols Raspberry, Mathilde Framboise, or Hiram Walker Raspberry Schnapps.\nAnother option is to explore the raspberry liqueurs from smaller producers, including Whidbey Distillery, Skip Rock Distillers, and St. George Spirits.\nThe average lime can yield up to 1 ounce of juice, so one fruit should be enough for two cocktails or one cocktail and a garnish. You can even simply squeeze the juice of a lime half into the shaker using a handheld citrus press.\nDress up the drink with a beautiful lime twist or skewer three raspberries on a cocktail pick and balance it on the rim. You can also rim the glass with sugar for a sweet touch.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a little extra fruit flavoring, muddle a few fresh raspberries with the simple syrup before shaking up the rest of the mix.\nAnother option is to add raspberry simple syrup to the recipe or use it as a substitute for the liqueur. Making it at home is as easy as any other fruit syrup, you'll simply use either fresh or frozen raspberries.\nIf you enjoy your margaritas frozen, the raspberry margarita recipe uses fresh raspberries. You can also blend raspberry liqueur into the mix instead of or along with the fruit.\nHow Strong Is a Raspberita?\nJust like other shaken margaritas, this is a pretty strong drink. Using the average tequila and raspberry liqueur, you can expect its alcohol content to fall in the 20 percent ABV (40 proof) range.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nUsing a softer gin like Hendrick's leaves you with a nice balance of sweet, sour, and spice and that brand happens to have a cucumber profile, so it's perfect here. The typical juniper-forward gins (like the London dry style) may be a little too much for some tastes, but they're definitely worth a try in this recipe.\nThe level of heat your drink will have is going to depend on how much wasabi you use. Start with a smaller amount at first because it is very easy to burn the drink. If you want it a little hotter, go with a little more paste in the next round. Remember, balancing flavors is key to a great cocktail.\nFine straining the cocktail means to pour it through a fine mesh strainer while using your regular cocktail strainer. For drinks like this, it's crucial because it will help filter out bits of wasabi and cucumber, especially the seeds.\nThe average slicer cucumber will work here, but you might want to consider using English cucumber for cocktails. This variety tends to be less bitter and the seeds are so small that, if they make it into the glass, they won't be an issue.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you like, pour vodka instead of gin. You can even try a cucumber vodka to really play up that flavor.\nSake is another great option for the base, particularly if you're going to pair the martini with Japanese cuisine for dinner.\nHow Strong Is a Cucumber Wasabi Martini?\nThe cucumber wasabi martini is packed with flavor but relatively light on the alcohol due to the fact that gin is the only liquor in the recipe. If you pour the average 80-proof gin, this drink shakes up to just 20 percent ABV (40 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is the Dorflinger?\nIt's always best to enjoy absinthe drinks in moderation, even limiting yourself to one per night, because it's a rather potent distilled spirit. Absinthe is often bottled at hefty 45 percent ABV (90 proof)?though it can be much stronger?and this recipe pours a significant amount of it. Plymouth Gin is 41.2 percent ABV (82.4 proof), though there is also a Navy Strength available at 57 percent ABV (117 proof).\n\nThese numbers should indicate that this is not, in any way, a weak drink, especially since they're the only ingredients in a Dorflinger. On average, with standard Plymouth Gin, this one has an alcohol content around 36 percent ABV (72 proof).\n\nIf you pour the stronger versions of either liquor, you will exceed the strength of a straight shot of the average whiskey, vodka, or tequila. That's one of the reasons the Dorflinger is poured as a 3-ounce drink, which is actually double the average shot.\nGin and Absinthe\nThe Dorflinger is not the only classic cocktail to play up the pairing of gin and absinthe, though it is one of the few that uses Plymouth Gin. The duo makes an appearance in a number of timeless recipes and, more often than not, absinthe's strong flavor is used as a more delicate accent.\nCorpse Reviver No. 2: Just a dash of absinthe is added to the gin version of the classic corpse reviver. This is a recipe every cocktail connoisseur should try at least once.\nFrench Pearl: Plymouth Gin and absinthe are together again in this fun cocktail that's rather unusual. That pairing is accented with fresh mint and lime, along with rock candy syrup.\nMonkey Gland: There is an interesting story behind this drink's unusual name, but don't let it detract you from trying it. The recipe rinses a cocktail glass with absinthe, leaving only the essence behind to flavor the sweeter taste of gin, orange juice, and grenadine. It's delicious.\nObituary Cocktail: A twist on the classic gin martini, this cocktail adds absinthe to the combination of gin and dry vermouth. It's invigorating and intriguing, the perfect choice for anyone who enjoys drier cocktails.\nTuxedo Cocktail: While you can use any anise liqueur in this classic recipe, absinthe is a great choice. Building on the famous combo of gin and dry vermouth, it adds maraschino and anise to the mix. The complexity is wonderful, and it's another cocktail you won't want to pass up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/dorflinger-cocktail-recipe-760074

It's very simple and should be done for both the watermelon juice and the cocktail to eliminate cucumber pieces. To do it, use your normal cocktail strainer while pouring through a fine-mesh strainer into the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you're going to use a substitute for Aviation, try to choose a gin with a similarly soft profile. Hendrick's is a great choice and the gin's cucumber notes are a perfect accent for this drink.\nSweeten up the drink with another clear, lightly flavored soda. Ginger ale or any citrus soda would be an excellent choice.\nYou could even switch to a flavored simple syrup, which is easy to make at home. Think of complementary flavors for the melon and cucumber, such as basil, mint, strawberry, or vanilla. Ginger syrup would add a fun spice, too.\nHow Strong Is a Watermelon Cucumber Cooler?\nDespite the fact that Aviation is bottle slightly stronger than the average gin (84 proof), this is a very light cocktail because it's the only alcohol.

Even freezing, which is recommended for preservation, is best reserved for food.\nTo ensure you have fresh basil available for your drinks, consider adding it to your garden. Even if just in your kitchen window, it's an easy plant to grow.\nMilligan suggests rich simple syrup for this recipe, so mix your sugar and water in equal parts (1:1 ratio).\nFresh lemon juice is always preferred for the best tasting cocktails, particularly ones like this that offer soft, fresh flavors. The average lemon should yield 1 3/4 ounces of juice, which is more than enough for one basil-ica cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, make a basil-infused simple syrup and skip the muddle. This is a good choice if your herbs are starting to wilt but you want to preserve their flavor. Simply use the basic simple syrup recipe and add five or so basil leaves, letting it steep until the syrup cools.\nThough Plymouth Gin is recommended, that doesn't mean other styles of gin won't work. You might want to try something with a softer profile than the average London dry, though. Think of brands like Hendrick's, Aviation, or The Botanist and explore your options from there.\nThis recipe would also be an excellent use for sage if you have that herb and run out of basil.\nHow Strong Is a Basil-ica?\nThe strength of the basil-ica is equivalent to the average martini that includes a few nonalcoholic mixers. Typically, it will shake up to about 23 percent ABV (46 proof). It's not the lightest drink, which is good to keep in mind because one too many can get you drunker than expected.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/basil-ica-cocktail-760056

If it\'s not sweet enough, add more syrup; too sweet, add a bit more citrus juice. The orange liqueur pour is generally pretty small, with some recipes using only 1/2 teaspoon.\nOriginally, the Knickerbocker recipe used Santa Cruz rum from St. Croix. Cocktail historian, David Wondrich, suggests in Esquire that any modern ""medium-bodied gold rum"" will be a good substitute.\nThe popular white rums of today will make a good drink, but the gold rums will give the drink more depth.\nThe History of the Knickerbocker\nThe Knickerbocker name has been used to describe some New Yorkers. According to Wondrich, it often refers to those of Dutch descent who enjoyed a bit more of a party than the more reserved ""Yankees.""\nIn 1806, Washington Irving wrote a satirical book about the city\'s culture during the time under the pen name, Diedrich Knickerbocker. The name has stuck around and was picked up by the New York Knicks as well as a number of establishments in the city, including the five-star Knickerbocker Hotel.\nThe Knickerbocker cocktail recipe appeared in the first bartending guide, Jerry Thomas\' 1862 ""Bon Vivant\'s Companion."" It is not known who created it or where, though there are many claims to its invention.\nAccording to drink expert, Simon Difford of Difford\'s Guide, there were a number of variations of the Knickerbocker around the turn of the 20th century. Two of those appeared in Harry Craddock\'s ""Savoy Cocktail Book"" from 1930.\nOne?the Knicker-bocker special cocktail?added a slice of pineapple and orange to the raspberry rum mix and served it straight up. It\'s a great drink and one you may want to try for yourself. The other?Knicker-bocker cocktail?is little more than a shaken perfect martini with just a dash of sweet vermouth.\nHow Strong Is a Knickerbocker?\nThe Knickerbocker may have a sweet, fruity taste, but it certainly packs a punch (something its namesakes likely would have enjoyed). On average, its alcohol content is 25 percent ABV (50 proof), which is typical of classic cocktails of this style.\nThe Ultimate Cocktails Guide']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/knickerbocker-cocktail-recipe-760093

Serve and enjoy.\nVodka and Orange Liqueur Saketini\n\nIt's very common to invert the ingredients' amounts so the vodka becomes the backup to a good sake. This switch also creates a significantly lighter cocktail. To make it, shake 2 1/2 ounces of sake with 1 ounce of vodka. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and add the garnish of your choice.\nFor a sweeter alternative, add a hint of orange liqueur?1/2 ounce or less?to the standard or inverted vodka version.\nGarnish Options\nThere are quite a few ways to dress up the saketini, and you can switch it up to fit your mood. Each option will slightly alter the drink's flavor, and they're just as interesting to experiment with as the alcohol combinations:\nOlives are always a good option for a clean martini. For the sake, though, you might find it best to stick with a single olive. Quite often, three is too overpowering, especially if you tend to drink rather slow.\nSliced cucumber is a favorite garnish for the saketini. Many people prefer the melon-like taste of the Japanese cucumber, though nearly any variety will add a crisp, cooling flavor to the drink. Cut a round slice or go with a very thin strip cut lengthwise down the cucumber. The first option can float on top of the drink and the second is beautiful when folded inside the glass like a ribbon.\nA maraschino cherry is a nice addition, but the sweet, almost strawberry-like taste of lychee is a wonderful way to brighten up the vodka and sake combo.\nHow Strong Is a Saketini?\nThe saketini will be just as strong as a gin or vodka martini because vermouth and sake are typically the same strength (15 percent ABV). You can expect this drink to fall in the 30 percent ABV (60 proof) range. It's definitely a potent mix, which is why drinks like this are served at just a few ounces.\nCherry Blossom-tini""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/saketini-recipe-with-gin-760117

Whereas drinkers a century ago may have had just a few gin options, we have far too many gins to choose from. Plus, the array of flavor profiles is unlike anything they could have probably imagined.\nThis means that this is a cocktail that you will not get bored with. For example, you can choose a traditional, juniper-forward London dry gin and savor how the botanicals play off the sweet and sour background. On days when you'd like something a little more delicate, a softer gin like Aviation or Hendricks may be a better fit. Then again, the recipe can also stand up to the full flavor of any navy strength gin as well.\nThe Pegu Club is a versatile cocktail. It's also a nice one to have in your repertoire while discovering new gins. If you are sampling a new-to-you bottle and want to know how the gin works with citrus, this is the best cocktail for the test.\nGranted, it won't work with every gin and you will like some combinations more than others. You will also find the need to tweak the ratio from time to time. Yet, uncovering that perfect match is half the fun of drinking. If the cocktail world was cut and dry, it would not be half as interesting as it is.\nHow Strong Is the Pegu Club?\nIt may look all neat and fancy, but like many similar cocktails, the Pegu Club is not a weak drink. This is particularly true if you pair an 80-proof gin with Cointreau or Grand Marnier (both of which are also 80-proof). In this case, the Pegu Club weighs in at around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).

The easiest approach is to cut a lemon wedge, then squeeze the juice from that into the shaker.\nFresh cranberries definitely make a prettier garnish than the dried variety. Dried cranberries look like raisins and do not float. Luckily, the fresh fruit is typically still in season around the December holidays.\nRecipe Variations\nPour any other style of gin that you like. Plymouth is unique and it pairs very well with fruits, but it's not your only option.

If you have a preference for rum, vodka, or whiskey, try it in this recipe. All of them pair nicely with cranberry.\nIf you skip the gin, you have a nice nonalcoholic alternative for anyone who doesn't drink.\nAs an alternative garnish, a long lemon twist or a sprig of mint will dress up the drink nicely. You can even add a cinnamon stick, which will infuse the spice into the drink and doubles as a stir stick.\nTry this cocktail with a fruit juice blend like cranberry-pomegranate as well.

Oranges can be quite large, so cut it in half or quarter the slice to better fit the glass.\nTransform the Martini Into a Party Punch\nThe flavor of this martini is the perfect base for a fruity gin punch. It can easily be made to serve any sized party, from an intimate brunch to a big wedding bash. Because the ingredients are poured equally, there is very little math involved. However, it is a strong drink. Adding a little soda will knock that down to better fit punch service while giving it a nice sparkle.\nBegin by adding twice as much soda as the total liquor volume: Use 1/3 part each of gin, blue cura?ao, and peach schnapps mixed with 2 parts ginger ale or club soda.

Look for it in the mixer section of the liquor store.\nDress up the punch bowl by freezing fresh berries, slices of citrus, and herbs into an ice ring.\nHow Strong Is the Sapphire Alpine?\nLooks are often deceiving and any martini made of liquor alone is going to be a potent little drink.

It would be best to choose a real apricot brandy, though some quality liqueur versions (such as Bols or Luxardo) are good options as well.\nAs with most martini-style cocktails, chilling your glass is highly recommended. The easiest way to do that is to place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're mixing the drink. Dump the ice before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nThough it's traditionally left ungarnished, a small orange wheel or a long, elegant twist are great options for dressing up the paradise cocktail. If you're squeezing fresh juice, cut the peel into a twist using a pairing knife or channel knife before cutting the orange in half to make the most out of a single piece of fruit.\nThis recipe is the up version of the drink, but a paradise shooter is also pretty popular. To make that drink, simply shake up equal parts (about 1/3 ounce each) of the same three ingredients and strain it into a shot glass.\nThe Boston cocktail is very similar to the paradise cocktail. In that recipe, you'll use equal parts gin and apricot brandy, accenting them with grenadine and lime juice.\nHow Strong Is a Paradise Cocktail?\nThe amount of orange juice in the paradise cocktail helps make this a nice and relaxed drink. It's not too strong, but it's not light either. On average, its alcohol content will be in the 18 percent ABV (36 proof) range.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/paradise-cocktail-recipe-760108

Serve and enjoy.\nTips for Making a Great Raspberry Bellini\nThe Liquor\nIf you have yet to taste cacha?a, this is a perfect cocktail introduction. It is very similar in profile to the spirit's most famous drink, the Caipirinha. Both drinks are very clean and rely on fresh fruits, which is really where this style of rum shines.\nLeblon is one of the most popular cacha?as available in the U.S. and should not be hard to find for most drinkers. If you get the chance, explore other brands as well because there are some very interesting options out there.\nIf, by chance, you do not have or cannot find cacha?a, use a good rum instead. Also, this cocktail is a perfect base for your favorite vodka.\nThe Champagne\nThere are many bottles of Champagne to choose from. Quite honestly, you probably cannot go wrong with any of them in this Raspberry Bellini recipe.\nDeciphering Champagne labels can be tricky. Most importantly, know that 'brut' means the wine has a drier profile while those with the word 'sec' will be sweeter.\nI have tried both dry and sweet Champagnes in this recipe and both finish the drink off nicely.\nFresh is Best\nFresh raspberries are not your only option here. If it is the dead of winter, dig into your stash of berries in the freezer and let them thaw before adding them to the cocktail.\nOn the other hand, fresh lime juice is going to make a superior Raspberry Bellini. The great news is that the citrus fruit can be found year-round. Sure the price and quality change, but they are there and many of the bottled juices are going to add too much sweetness to the drink.\nThe average lime holds between 1/2 and 1 ounce of juice, which is far more than the recipe calls for. If you want to get technical, a 'dash' is right around 1/32 ounce (or 1/5 teaspoon). Juice your lime into a separate glass and pour just a 'dash' into the shaker. There is really no need to measure this one!\nJust a Hint of Sweetness\nGo easy on the sugar! Remember that rums are sugar-based liquors and cacha?a is made from pure sugar cane. There is no need to add more than a dash of sugar, particularly if you are using a sec or demi-sec Champagne.\nSuperfine sugar is recommended because the crystals are a little smaller than granulated sugar. This makes it a just a little bit easier to dissolve in the drink. In a pinch, use your kitchen sugar and all will be fine.\nIf you like, go with simple syrup rather than straight sugar. Depending on how concentrated your syrup is, just a dash will do. At times, I may even call the perfect measurement a 'drizzle' depending on the wine and rum.\nHow Strong Is the Raspberry Bellini?\nLeblon is an 80-proof cachaca and if we were to use a 12 percent ABV Champagne, the Raspberry Bellini would be a relatively mild drink. We could estimate it to be about 18 percent ABV (36 proof) with a 4-ounce wine pour.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-bellini-champagne-cocktail-760554

No matter the color, any fruity flavor will work out just fine, so have fun designing this drink to fit your party\'s style.\nSwitch to vodka in the cocktail or rum in the gelatin if you\'d like to make this drink with a single liquor. Tequila would be a fun option, too.\nPineapple juice or a blend of fruit juices are good substitutes for the orange juice.\nHow Strong Is a Swamp Water Surprise?\nThe swamp water surprise is a pretty strong drink. Though it\'s just an estimate and will vary, if you choose to slurp up the gelatin along with the drink, the alcohol content may be as high as 26 percent ABV (52 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis is a great recipe to use as you explore new bottles of cacha?a. The liquor is as diverse as any other, and each distiller puts their own spin on the traditional methods. You'll also find a lot of cacha?as that use different types of wood barrels for aging, which only adds to the depth of possible flavors.\nCinnamon syrup is a very popular drink sweetener used for cocktails, coffee, and tea. You can find it from most of the major beverage syrup companies. It's also very easy to make cinnamon syrup at home with sugar, water, and a cinnamon stick.\nFresh citrus juices are going to produce the best-tasting cocktail. For the lime, simply squeeze half of one fruit directly into the shaker (use the other half to cut the garnish). The average grapefruit can yield up to 5 or 6 ounces, more than enough for a few drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nAdjust the citrus juices and cinnamon syrup to taste and the cacha?a you ultimately decide to pour. Some may do well with a little less grapefruit or sweetener, while others could use an extra dose of lime.\nTry this cocktail with an aged rum instead of cacha?a. The taste will be nearly the same, though you will notice some subtle differences between the two spirits.\nHow Strong Is a Rhyme and Reason Cocktail?\nThis cocktail holds a ton of flavor inside, but it's surprisingly light on the alcohol. If you follow the recipe, it will shake up to around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That places it right in line with the average wine, only this drink offers a far more intriguing taste experience.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rhyme-and-reason-cocktail-recipe-760556

That recipe pours one shot each of rum, brandy, and orange juice, then adds lemon juice along with both simple syrup and orgeat to accent the flavors.\nScorpion Bowl\nThe scorpion bowl is both a drink and a vessel for serving punch to a small party of four or five people. They are a common site at tiki bars and Chinese restaurants.\nA scorpion bowl is a small punch bowl of about 32 ounces that sits on a pedestal. The bowl is often ceramic and decorated in lavish tropical-style with bright colors. In the middle, is a small ""volcano"" bowl that is designed to be filled with overproof rum and lit on fire.\nThe scorpion bowl is set on a table and each drinker is given their own extra-long straw. The experience of drinking this large punch with a group of friends is fun. It\'s relatively easy to find the bowls in online stores.\nThe actual drink that goes into the scorpion bowl can be anything you like. Many people choose to mix up a variation of the original scorpion recipe, though the volume does need to be cut down to account for the smaller bowl.\nTip\nBe careful when drinking and playing with fire. Do not let anyone reach or lean over the flaming volcano. Hair and clothing can catch on fire very quickly, especially when fueled with alcohol.\nHow Strong Is a Scorpion?\nThe scorpion is one of the strongest punch drinks you can mix up and is similar in strength to a single-serve shaken daiquiri. When made according to the recipe, it should weigh in no more than 21 percent ABV (42 proof), though it will get weaker as the ice dilutes the punch.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/scorpion-cocktail-recipe-760597

Shake it once or twice a day. Beginning on the third day, test the flavor of the infusion daily.\nOnce the watermelon flavor is to your taste, strain the watermelon from the vodka. You may need to strain twice or use a cheesecloth to remove all of the fruit and seeds.\nWash the jar and return the flavored vodka to it. Store as you would any other vodka.\nMix the watermelon vodka into cocktails and enjoy.\nTips\nIt's best to cut the rind off the melon to maximize space and flavor. If you end up having less watermelon than you'd like, leave the infusion for a few extra days to strengthen the flavor. \nA quart-sized jar will hold almost 950 milliliters. That leaves plenty of room for the fruit and an entire bottle of vodka.\nWhile there are many fancy infusion jars available, an old-fashioned Mason jar is often the best choice. They're cheap, have a wide mouth that's easy to work with, and useful for other projects.\nIf you save the original vodka bottle, reuse it for your finished infusion. Clean it out, remove the label, and even create your own custom label.\nRecipe Variations\nMake a melon vodka medley by adding other types of melon to the infusion. Canteloupe, honeydew, or any melon can be added to create your own custom blend. The infusion time should not be any different than with watermelon alone.\nIf you like, add other fruits like mango or berries to the infusion. Herbs like basil and lemongrass are nice flavor pairing options as well. When doing these flavor experiments, begin with a smaller batch and taste it regularly after about 3 days. Once you perfect your custom vodka, then it's time to go big and make a full bottle.\nDon't be afraid to branch out! This recipe is just as good with white rum or silver tequila.

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.\nTip\nIf you choose to add the egg, you'll find that this recipe is best when you use the double shaking method described. The first round is done as a dry shake and the second includes ice and should be shaken for at least 30 seconds. Taking the time for this will ensure you get a wonderful froth in the finished cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a number of options available for each of the distilled spirits in the pumpkin spice martini. If you don't have one of the specific liquors called for in the recipe, don't worry because you may have a viable substitute.\nRather than rye whiskey, a bold bourbon like Wild Turkey 101 or Bulleit can stand up nicely in this recipe. A great reposado tequila is an impressive option as well.\nPumpkin is a seasonal liqueur that can be hard to find at times. It will vary from year to year as it's not the most profitable flavor for liquor companies to produce. Bols Pumpkin Spice and Hiram Walker Pumpkin Spice are two that tend to stick around. If you can't find one, try about 1 ounce of pumpkin spice syrup. These tend to be readily available because they're used to flavor all those pumpkin spiced lattes that pop up in the fall.\nAs with any cocktail, triple sec is not your only orange liqueur option. You could pour a cura?ao or a brandy-based option like Grand Marnier instead.\nFor the anise liqueur, you have a number of options. Absinthe is really nice here, but Abisante, Herbsaint, or any of the other liqueurs of this flavor are just fine. This flavor is key to adding a little more depth to the pumpkin flavor.\n It's understandable that some people are wary of drinking raw eggs. You can either skip that entirely and enjoy a non-creamy cocktail or substitute it with about 1/2 ounce of half and half.\nHow Strong Is a Pumpkin Spice Martini?\nThe alcohol content of the pumpkin spice martini is going to vary depending on the liquors you choose to mix into it. With an 80-proof whiskey, 90-proof absinthe (typically the lightest option), and the average for the liqueurs, it will come in at a hefty 23 percent ABV (46 proof).

Stir well.\nGarnish with a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nThis mixed drink is very similar to other popular whiskey highballs, including the Highball, which simply uses ginger ale. If we were to top Scotch with ginger ale alone and add a touch of lime, we have a Mamie Taylor. If bourbon is your whiskey of choice and you use lemon, syrup and club soda, you would have the tasty John Collins.\nChoose Your Whiskey\nOne thing is for sure when it comes to the Presbyterian: whiskey is necessary. Whether that whiskey is a Scotch, bourbon, rye, or any other whiskey is a matter of personal taste.\nBourbon has become the new favorite whiskey of choice and is a good place to begin. You might try a robust bourbon so the whiskey doesn't get lost in the soda.\nIf you are a fan of Scotch, pouring that style of whisky into a Presbyterian is a more traditional way to serve the drink. This also tends to explain the drink's name because the Presbyterian Church was founded in Scotland.\nFor Scotch, stick with a good blended whisky. An inexpensive brand that won't break your budget works great in a Presbyterian.\nChoose Your Sodas\nYou will need two sodas to make a Presbyterian cocktail. The club soda and ginger ale mentioned in the recipe are the most common. Some recipes will use 7-Up or another lemon-lime soda rather than ginger ale, but most drinkers will agree that ginger ale is best.\nUnless you decide to make your Presbyterian with a high-end Scotch, there's really no reason to go overboard on the sodas. If you do upgrade the whisky, I would recommend choosing a boutique soda from Fever-Tree or Q Drinks. Both make excellent cocktail-worthy sodas.\nIn the majority of cases, you can get away with the more common sodas. Canada Dry is a personal favorite for an everyday ginger ale and Schweppes and Seagram's make a great club soda.\nBe sure to buy smaller bottles of soda if you are making just one or two drinks so the soda is as fresh as can be. Open those bottles slowly! They really like to fizz up.\nWhile it is common that the two sodas are poured equally, some drinkers find that they prefer a little more ginger ale than soda or vice versa. Be sure to adjust the drink to your taste and the whiskey you choose. After all, it is your drink!\nHow Strong Is the Presbyterian Cocktail?\nTo estimate the strength of the Presbyterian, we need to make a few assumptions. Let's assume we use an 80-proof whiskey and end up pouring about 5 ounces of soda in total. In this case, the drink would be a mild 9 percent ABV (18 proof). Of course, that is going to vary based on your choices.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/presbyterian-cocktail-recipe-761485

It tends to lend a nice balance to the drink and mixes well with almost any flavor, and there are many great brands to choose from.\nAs with any cocktail in the martini or Manhattan style, feel free to adjust the whisky to sweet vermouth ratio to fit your taste. The amounts in the recipe are the most common, and you might want to tweak that with different scotches.\nThere are also lots of options when it comes to the orange bitters. It's one of the most popular flavors and at least one bottle should be in every well-stocked bar.\nIf you do not have absinthe, try an anise-flavored liqueur as a substitute.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Bobby Burns cocktail is a classic twist on the Robert Burns. It is typically mixed with a Highland single malt scotch and uses the same proportions of whiskey and sweet vermouth. The difference is that the Bobby Burns skips the absinthe and bitters, pouring 1/2 ounce Benedictine instead.\nDon't be afraid to mix with a single malt scotch. It's a fantastic choice for simple and sophisticated cocktails like this and there are a number of affordable options, so you won't be wasting money. Since each region of Scotland produces whiskies with distinct flavor characteristics, you will experience a new Robert Burns each time. It's like taking a tour of the countryside without leaving home!\nHow Strong Is a Robert Burns?\nUp cocktails made entirely of alcohol are pretty potent drinks. If you were to pour an 80-proof scotch into your Robert Burns, you could expect it to have an alcohol content of 28 percent ABV (56 proof) or so.

It's easy to make?all you need is lemon juice, sugar, and water?and you can customize the sweet and sour to suit your taste.

Stir together the liquors and lemonade in a pitcher, add thin lemon wheels, and place in the refrigerator until well chilled. Pour over ice in tall glasses, leaving room for the soda.\nRecipe Variations\nTo make this for a crowd, simply increase the ingredients while keeping the proportions in the recipe. For instance, for 10 tall drinks, you'll need 15 ounces (1 3/4 cups) whiskey, 5 ounces strawberry liqueur, 40 ounces (5 cups) lemonade, and 20 ounces (2 1/2 cups) soda. If you're going more of the party punch route, the average serving is just 4 ounces, so that will serve twice as many guests.\nIf you prefer, switch the strawberry out for another fruity liqueur. Raspberry, blackberry, cr?me de cassis, mango, and pomegranate are all great options.\nHow Strong Is a Red Stag Lemonade?\nThe lemonade and soda make up most of the volume in this tall drink, so it's a surprisingly light whiskey cocktail. When made according to the recipe, the Red Stag lemonade has an alcohol content of about 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That's lighter than a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-stag-lemonade-761488

The majority of ports are relatively inexpensive, so even a high-end port will not break the bank. If you prefer, a ruby port is a good substitute.\nYou'll notice that the recipe is very specific about how much stirring is required. While you don't have to be so precise, it's a good recommendation to follow. The 30 rounds of stirring?a round is one revolution around the glass?mixes the ingredients perfectly and gives it the ideal amount of dilution from the ice. You can use this same approach for nearly any alcohol-only cocktail, including the martini or Manhattan.\nGenerally, you do not have to be as cautious with the burnt orange peel as you would with other flamed cocktails. This is a relatively safe cocktail because the citrus oils will not actually catch on fire, but create small sparks instead. That said, do be careful near highly concentrated alcohol, paper, or anything that is flammable. Better safe than sorry!\nRecipe Variation\nSince Averna is a proprietary recipe, it's difficult to find a viable substitute for it. However, you can use this recipe to explore other brands of amaro?Italian bitters?such as Amaro Ciociaro or Amaro Montenegro.\nHow Strong Is a Beatnik Cocktail?\nAs you might expect, any cocktail that's only made of alcoholic ingredients is not going to be a weak drink. The beatnik certainly proves this point, weighing in with an average alcohol content of 27 percent ABV (54 proof). It's like drinking a Manhattan and a few rounds will add up, possibly leading to a wicked hangover.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-beatnik-cocktail-recipe-761508

(You can also rinse the mixing glass before this next step.)\nPour the whiskey and vermouth into a mixing glass filled with ice.\nStir for 30 seconds.\nStrain into the rinsed glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nWhich Whiskey Should You Use?\nRye whiskey is typically used in the Waldorf Cocktail though there was a time when good ryes were extremely rare. That led many bartenders to do as they did in other whiskey cocktails and turn to bourbon. Either is a nice choice, though now that rye is making a big comeback, you should consider getting a taste of the original.\nThere are a number of rye whiskeys to choose from and almost any on the market will be excellent in the Waldorf. Whiskey made from rye is considerably spicier than other styles and it may not be for everyone. They certainly are among the most flavorful whiskeys, yet a good bourbon can stand up just as well in this cocktail. \nNo matter which style of whiskey you choose for the Waldorf Cocktail, make it a good one with full-body flavor. Softer whiskeys will not stand up to even a hint of absinthe and this is a cocktail that requires you bring out the best you have in stock.\nHow Strong Is the Waldorf Cocktail?\nMany of the whiskeys we've discussed exceed a bottling strength above the standard 80-proof. A higher alcohol content often means more flavor and these will do much better in the Waldorf Cocktail.\n\nFor that reason, let's estimate the drink's strength using a 100-proof whiskey. In this case, the cocktail will weigh in right around 35 percent ABV (70 proof), which in no way is considered a light drink. Take it easy with this one and enjoy.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/waldorf-cocktail-recipe-761514

Serve and enjoy.\nThough it's designed as a shooter, the snowshoe makes a very pleasant lowball drink when served on the rocks. Enjoy one after dinner for a soothing sipper.\nYour Liquor Options\nWild Turkey can be a strong bourbon, depending on which bottle you choose. The 101-proof is one of the brand's most popular whiskies and, if you choose to mix with that, this shot is going to be rather strong.\nLikewise, peppermint schnapps varies greatly and you can find a mild bottle of 30-proof schnapps or one like Rumple Minze that tops off at 100-proof. This extra alcohol adds to the peppermint's punch and can make a big difference in your snowshoe's strength and flavor.\nPre-Mix the Snowshoe\nThere may be some occasions when you want to have a mixed shooter ready to go. Maybe you're looking to eliminate carrying liquor bottles and bar gear to your campsite or cabin. Then again, you may not want to bother mixing drinks during a party and prefer to prepare things in advance. No matter the scenario, the snowshoe is an ideal candidate for mix-ahead shot.\nSince the recipe requires equal parts of two shelf-stable liquors, it's very easy to mix up ahead of time. Simply shake up as much as you need and pour it into a flask, carafe, or another small container. There's no need to refrigerate it. It will be ready to pour directly into shot glasses when the time comes, so you can enjoy hassle-free fun with friends.\nHow Strong Is the Snowshoe?\nSince the snowshoe can vary greatly in strength, you may be interested to compare the two extremes. On one side, if you mix Wild Turkey 101 with Rumple Minze, your shot will be somewhere around 38 percent ABV (76 proof). If, on the other hand, you choose to pour an 80-proof bourbon and 30-proof schnapps, it will be around 26 percent ABV (52 proof).\n\nEven at its mildest, the snowshoe is not a light shot. Yet, in comparison to pouring two 100-proof spirits, it's relatively mild.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/snowshoe-shot-recipe-761500

Add ice and shake again.\nStrain into a cocktail glass.\nSlowly pour the grenadine around the inner edge of the glass. It will run down the sides and sink to the bottom, creating the sunrise effect.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nUnlike other sunrise cocktails, there is no ice to filter the grenadine, so pouring it around the glass (rather than directly in the middle) helps it sink as intended.\nOne lemon should yield enough juice for a single drink. For the orange, a single fruit should produce enough juice for at least four cocktails, if not more.\nAs with most ""up"" drinks, serving this in a chilled glass is highly recommended. Since cocktail glasses don\'t fit conveniently in the average freezer, you can give it a quick chill by placing a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix the drink. Simply discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nOther styles of whiskey can add an interesting twist to the drink\'s flavor.\nTry this drink with other liquors instead of whiskey. Tequila\'s a natural choice and interesting against the high concentration of lemon; a vodka is also an excellent option, though aged rum is fun as well.\nDouble or triple the amount of orange juice to create a drink that\'s less tart. The slightly taller drink will likely have to be poured into an old-fashioned glass to hold the extra volume and you can always serve it on the rocks if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Sour Sunrise Cocktail?\nFor a drink served in the martini style, the sour sunrise is surprisingly light. Much of that is due to the fact that bourbon is the only liquor. Even when using a 90 proof bourbon, the drink mixes up to just 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That\'s more along the lines of a glass of wine and half of the Manhattan\'s strength.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sour-sunrise-cocktail-recipe-761476

Whether you choose rye or bourbon, be sure to pour a premium brand so the drink has a quality foundation.\nNo matter which sweet vermouth you choose, make sure that it's fresh. Fortified wine has a much shorter shelf life than distilled spirits; three months is the recommended limit for an open bottle before it begins to go stale.\nRecipe Variations\nApparently, the original liberal cocktail recipe poured equal parts (3/4 ounce) of each of the three main ingredients. Over the years, people found this version to be too sweet, so it was reformulated to the ratio in the recipe above.\nStill another ratio pours equal parts of whiskey and sweet vermouth (3/4 ounce each) with a few dashes of amaro. This also seems to be a modern twist.\nIn one variation from the early 1900s, a few dashes of absinthe is added to the recipe that uses equal proportions. In another, the vermouth is left out entirely and a dash of simple syrup is added instead.\nA popular variation is called the Cuban liberal cocktail. For this one, pour white rum instead of whiskey. It's also commonly garnished with an orange twist.\nHow Strong Is the Liberal Cocktail?\nLike most drinks of this style, the liberal cocktail is a pretty strong drink. Though you might pour something stronger (it's not a bad idea), when made with 80 proof whiskey, it mixes up to an alcohol content of 24 percent ABV (48 proof) or so.

Make sure to thaw them first.\nFresh lemon juice is definitely recommended. To get the 1/2 ounce needed, you should be able to simply squeeze half a lemon directly into the glass.\nUse real maple syrup rather than pancake syrup for the best drink. In a pinch, you can even make mock maple syrup with white and brown sugars, water, butter, and maple (or vanilla) extract.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can also make this drink in a cocktail shaker, shake it with ice, then strain it into a chilled cocktail glass.\nSkip the muddle if you prefer and use 1 ounce of strawberry puree rather than the fresh strawberries. This version is best when shaken and strained. It can be served on the rocks or up.\nHow Strong Is a Kentucky Kiss Cocktail?\nIt may be sweet and fruity, but this is not a light drink, especially when it's made with a 90-proof whiskey.

You could use absinthe or any of its substitutes. Pernod and Herbsaint are both excellent options, as are anisette, ouzo, pastis, and sambuca.\nThe vanilla liqueur has many options as well. Bols Vanilla is a great choice and there are a few brands that make vanilla schnapps. For a light herbal twist, there's Galliano. Though anise is also a dominant flavor of the L'Autentico formula (the most popular bottle), the brand does make a vanilla liqueur as well. If you want to add a little more citrus to the drink, try Tuaca.\nRecipe Variations\nJust like the Manhattan, you can serve this drink on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass if you prefer.\nAnother option for the anise liqueur is to rinse the glass. It's a technique used in classic drinks like the corpse reviver no. 2 where just a hint of absinthe is desired. To do this, pour a small amount of the liqueur in the chilled glass, swirl it around to coat the inside, then dump out any excess.\nHow Strong Is a Mile High Manhattan\nWhenever a drink is served in the martini style and made entirely of liquor, you should expect it to be a strong drink. That's definitely the case for the Mile High Manhattan, which has an average alcohol content of 36 percent ABV (72 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you're cutting pineapple garnishes, you already have fresh pineapple juice available. You'll need just a splash, so muddle a few chunks of pineapple in your cocktail shaker to release all of the juice, then strain it as if you just made a cocktail.\nCream of coconut is the most popular coconut mixer available. It's easy to find at the liquor store because it's essential for a pi?a colada. It will produce the creamiest coconut martini and, unlike coconut cream, it is sweetened.\nKeep your pineapple wedge garnishes petite so they don't overtake the cocktail glass or make it top-heavy. Cut a slit in the wedge so it can easily rest on the rim. If you like, skewer a cherry to the pineapple for a splash of color.\nYou may also want to rim the glass with coconut sugar, toasted coconut, or coconut flakes. Just remember to do so before straining the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want a thinner coconut drink, use canned coconut milk (the carton variety might be a little too lightly flavored). Since it tends to separate in the can, you can use either the thick top portion or the thinner milk underneath. For balance, mix the two layers back together.\nIf either your coconut milk or cream is unsweetened, consider stirring in a little sugar or adding 1/2 ounce or so of simple syrup to the martini.\nSkip the pineapple juice but get the same effect by switching the two liquor flavors. For instance, you can use pineapple vodka and vanilla rum or vanilla vodka and pineapple rum, then let the cream take care of the coconut flavor.\nCan You Make Coconut Rum From Scratch?\nCoconut rum is very common and there are many brands to choose from at the liquor store. They almost always lean toward the liqueur side of distilled spirits, meaning they're low-proof and often very sweet or made with artificial coconut flavoring. If you want a fresh-tasting coconut rum, it's easy to make yourself and as simple as any other liquor infusion:\nRemove the white meat from a fresh coconut and chop it up so it can fit inside your infusion jar or bottle.\nAdd the light rum of your choice and seal the bottle.\nShake it vigorously and store the infusion in a dark, cool place for about 2 weeks. Shake it regularly to keep the flavors alive.\nTaste your rum and, if you'd like the flavor to be a bit more intense, continue infusing until it's to your liking.\nStrain out the coconut and bottle your homemade coconut rum.\nHow Strong Is the Coconut Martini?\nCompared to many other martini recipes, the coconut martini is relatively light because the two liquors tend to be lower than their standard 80-proof, unflavored counterparts. With a 70-proof vanilla vodka and 42-proof coconut rum, this martini's alcohol content falls around 21 percent ABV (42 proof). That's equal to a straight shot of the rum, though yours may be stronger depending on your spirits of choice.\n11 Delicious Coconut Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/coconut-martini-recipe-759080

This is a great option if you're also muddling pineapple for its juice.\nHow Strong Is a Coco Light Martini?\nMost flavored vodkas are 70 proof, which is a little lighter than standard vodka. Since it is the only alcohol in the recipe, you can expect it to have a low alcohol content and fall somewhere in the 11 percent ABV (22 proof) range. That makes this one of the lowest-proof martinis you can mix up and more along the lines of a vodka tonic.\nDoes coconut vodka have sugar?\nRegular vodka is naturally sugar-free, but coconut vodka may include sugar. It varies by brand and depends on the ingredients added to obtain the flavor. Coconut contains natural sugars, and coconut vodkas that do have sugar tend to contain between 2 and 7 grams per 1 1/2-ounce shot. Most flavored vodka producers do not disclose nutrition info or ingredients, though you can contact a company to inquire about a product. When in doubt, pour an unflavored vodka instead.\nCan you make coconut vodka at home?\nHomemade coconut vodka is as easy as any other vodka infusion: Combine about 1/2 cup of unsweetened coconut chips or flakes and 750 milliliters of vodka in a quart-sized jar (or larger). Keep sealed and shake daily, infusing for about four days or until it reaches your desired flavor intensity. Strain out the coconut and store it like any other vodka.\n11 Delicious Coconut Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ciroc-coco-light-martini-recipe-759090

It is much like the bacon fat-washed whiskey used in the PB and bacon shooter.\nVodka has a more transparent flavor than whiskey, so in this case, I would recommend infusing for about 4-6 hours. Of course, you can go longer if you want a more intense bacon flavor.\nEssentially, we use the fatty grease produced from pan frying bacon to flavor the vodka. Technically, this technique is bacon washing rather than infusing. It is very easy and a great way to repurpose bacon fat after cooking a hearty breakfast.\nFor the ratio of vodka to bacon fat, I would recommend 1 tablespoon of bacon fat for every 375 milliliters of vodka. If you want to infuse a full 750-milliliter bottle of vodka, begin with 2 tablespoons of fat.\nBegin by frying a few pieces of bacon. Enjoy eating the cooked bacon and reserve the fat for the infusion.\nAllow the bacon fat to cool for a few minutes.\nFill a clean mason jar with vodka and add the bacon fat using the measurement recommendations above.\nSecure the lid on the jar and shake vigorously.\nAllow the jar to rest at room temperature for about 4 to 6 hours.\nPlace the jar in the freezer for about 30 minutes until the bacon fat solidifies. Freezing will make the fat easier to remove in the next step. Don\'t worry, the vodka will not freeze.\nPlace cheesecloth or a coffee filter in a fine mesh strainer resting on top of a clean jar or bowl and slowly pour the infused vodka into the filter. All of the bacon fat should be caught in the filter and if some goes through, repeat this step until your vodka is clean.\nTransfer the bacon-infused vodka into a clean jar with a tight-fitting lid. You can also use a funnel to transfer it back into the original vodka bottle.\nLabel the bottle as ""Bacon Vodka"" (so there are no surprises) and store it as you would any other vodka.\nMake the Cocktail\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the hard cider, bacon vodka, maple syrup, and bitters. Fill with ice.\nStir well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a brandied cherry and a small strip of bacon. Serve and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is a Bacon Me Angry?\nAssuming that an 80-proof vodka is used, the finished cocktail should be right around 7 percent ABV (14 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bacon-me-angry-cocktail-recipe-759089

Enjoy.\nTips\nThis is a great punch to mix up ahead of time. Much like a sangria, combining the ingredients then letting it rest in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours will allow the pineapple chunks (if using) and sage to add even more flavor to the drink.\nWhen making it in advance, hold the ice until it's time to serve or add it to the serving glasses to minimize dilution.\nFresh lime juice makes a better tasting drink. The average lime yields almost 1 ounce of juice, so you will need at least 8 pieces of fruit for this recipe.\nWhen using a juicer, you can expect to get about 1 1/2 cups of juice from a third of the average pineapple. The recipe requires 1 1/4 cups, so one pineapple will leave you with plenty of extra fruit to add chunks to the pitcher and for garnishing.\nPineapple is a very juicy fruit, so if you don't have an electric juicer, you can muddle chunks to extract its juice (strain out the mashed fruit to produce a chunk-free juice). It won't be as efficient or quick, but the fresh taste is worth the effort. You will likely need half of a pineapple to get the juice needed for the recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nAs written, the recipe yields about eight 5-ounce servings. You can certainly increase it to for a larger party and even make enough to fill a punch bowl. Simply keep the ingredients in proportion for the servings or volume needed. There's no need to add more sage unless you go really big, though, because its flavor will infuse a good amount of liquid perfectly.\nIf you want to make this as a single drink, begin with a muddle of 3/4 ounce of simple syrup and 2 sage leaves in a cocktail shaker. Add 1 1/2 ounces of gin, 1 ounce of lime juice, and 1 1/4 ounces of pineapple juice. Shake it with ice, then strain it into a cocktail glass or an old-fashioned glass with fresh ice.\nHow Strong Is a Pineapple Sage Gimlet?\nBombay Sapphire is a full-flavored gin that's bottled at 94 proof rather than the liquor's standard of 80 proof. That does ramp up this gimlet's alcohol content slightly, but with all the juice, it's not significant. On average, the punch should weigh in around 17 percent ABV (34 proof), which is a little stronger than the average wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pineapple-and-sage-gimlet-recipe-759065

Fill with ice.\nStir well.\nStrain over fresh ice in a double rocks glass.\nGarnish with an orange twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSauza 901 is a silver tequila, so it is not aged in oak. If you're going for a substitute, choose another silver tequila. The majority of tequila brands produce each of the three main styles of tequila.\nIf, on the first round, you find that this cocktail has too much Campari, cut back to 1/2 ounce and make up the difference with vermouth. It can take a little time to get used to the aperitif's bitter flavor. A gentle introduction can help you develop the palate for it.\nTo slow down dilution while you enjoy the Tequiliano, serve the drink over an ice ball or similar large piece of ice rather than cubes.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you enjoy the Tequiliano with silver tequila, try it with a reposado. The extra oak flavor works rather well in this recipe, bringing in an extra layer of flavor.\nDry vermouth is another option for this recipe and will produce a slightly drier drink.\nAdding an extra spritz of citrus can be helpful as well. If you're garnishing with an orange twist, express the peel's essence over the drink by giving it a tight squeeze before adorning your glass. Another option is to add a dash or two of orange bitters.\nHow Strong Is a Tequiliano?\nWith three alcoholic beverages in this cocktail, including a long shot of tequila, the Tequiliano is not a weak drink. It has an alcohol content around 24 percent ABV (48 proof); equivalent to drinking Campari on its own. Getting drunk off an aperitif is usually not an issue though, and one drink is usually enough. Most people will move on to another drink as dinner progresses.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tequiliano-cocktail-recipe-759069

Continue infusing for 2 to 3 days, or longer, until the flavor reaches your desired intensity.\nStrain out the ginger, bottle the bourbon, and store just like any other whiskey.\nTips\nAn infusion of ginger can take up to two weeks. It simply depends on how intense you want the flavor.\nYou can speed up the infusion slightly by using more ginger, though the patient approach is still best.\nUse this ginger whiskey for other cocktails while you have it! Simple is often best, so look to popular whiskey cocktails like the highball and old-fashioned.\nMake the Ginger Julep '68 Fastback\nGather the ingredients.\nIn an old-fashioned glass, muddle the ginger and brown sugar together until all of the sugar is moistened and nearly dissolved.\nAdd a dash of soda to finish dissolving the sugar, stir in the bourbon.\nFinish by filling the glass with ice, add soda to taste.\nGarnish with a lemon or lime twist.

Simply combine about 1 1/2 cups passion fruit, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in your blender or food processor and blend about 30 seconds, or until smooth.\nCinnamon-infused tequila is also simple and a good alternative if you can\'t find a commercial alternative. Simply add a cinnamon stick to tequila in an infusion jar. Let it infuse for about 3 or 4 days, or until it reaches your desired flavor, then remove the cinnamon and bottle the tequila. Don\'t put the stick in a tequila bottle as it will soak up the liquid and expand, making it impossible to remove through the bottle\'s neck.\nRecipe Variations\nThis cocktail would also be great when served ""up"" in a cocktail glass. Be sure to chill the glass before straining in order to keep it chilled longer since you won\'t be using ice.\nJust like real horchata, this recipe can easily be increased to fill a small pitcher for a few people. Keep everything in proportion and chill it in the refrigerator, then pour it over ice to serve.\nIf you were to substitute anything for real horchata in this drink, RumChata is your best bet because it was inspired by the traditional drink. Though it is a dairy liqueur, it is readily available and mixes nicely with cinnamon and fruits.\nOther fruits can work just as well as passion fruit. You could, for instance, go with apple, apricot, blood orange, pear, pineapple, or pomegranate, all of which pair nicely with cinnamon. Either buy or create a puree out of the fruit or pick up packaged options like juice or nectar.\nHow Strong Is a Spiked Passion Fruit Horchata Cocktail?\nWhen made with an 80-proof tequila, this drink weighs in at a pleasantly mild 16 percent ABV (32 proof).

If all you have is the white variety of the sweet mint liqueur, use it. The drink will taste the same, it just won't be green.\nThe dessert vodka boom brought out a number of delicious chocolate vodka options. You can find it from well-known vodka brands like 360, Pinnacle, Three Olives, and Van Gogh, but there are many others that are worth exploring as well.\nServing this martini in a well-chilled glass makes it so much better. If you're serving it for dessert, place the glasses in the freezer while you eat. For a quick chill, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're pouring and shaking.\nRecipe Variations\nHave fun garnishing this martini with extra chocolate. Place a few chocolate shavings on top, drizzle some chocolate syrup into the glass then freeze it before making the drink, or go with a cocoa powder rim. You could even lay a small candy bar or chocolate cookie along the inside of the glass.\nTo make a shooter, strain the drink into chilled shot glasses. The recipe should fill 2 (2-ounce) shot glasses or up to four smaller ones.\nIf you don't have chocolate vodka, you can use clear vodka and add a chocolate liqueur.

You can also use St. Germain (or another brand of the floral liqueur) or an elderflower cordial as a substitute.\nThe other matter of note is the pure pine honey, which is also known as pine tree honey or honeydew honey. It is a special honey that has nice pine and nut notes and is made by honeybees collecting sap from pine trees.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nHoney syrup is easy to make. It's simply a diluted version of honey that makes the sweetener a little easier to mix into cold drinks. To make it, mix equal parts honey and water until you get an even consistency: for this recipe, that's 1/4 ounce of each.\nYou can use simple syrup or agave nectar as alternative sweeteners in the pineapple mimosa.\nFresh citrus juices really are going to produce a better tasting mimosa. You will not regret taking the time to squeeze lemons and oranges; one of each should yield enough juice for a few cocktails.\nAny style of sparkling wine, including Champagne, will work great in this recipe. The Italian prosecco is a great choice and one of the more budget-friendly options.\nRecipe Variation\nServing this pineapple mimosa at brunch is just a little easier if you make it by the pitcher. The single-drink recipe is very easy to adapt to any size you want to mix up, making it ideal for parties.\nFor instance, simply do a little math to fill the average drink pitcher, which is around 60 ounces. Begin by pouring 10 ounces (1 1/4 cups) of the vodka and 5 ounces (2/3 cup) of each of the juices and syrup. Just before serving, fill the pitcher with ice, then top it with prosecco.\nAdding a little more sparkling wine to the pitcher than you would for a single drink will help keep the sparkle longer. The drink will be sitting out in the pitcher and the ice will dilute it a bit, so it's good to add more carbonation from the beginning.\nWhen making this conversion, it would be best to add the honey syrup to taste. Do this by combining the vodka and juices, then add 1/4 cup of the syrup at a time. Mix it together and give it a taste test until it hits your desired sweetness.\nHow Strong Is a Pineapple Mimosa?\nLike most flavored vodkas, C?roc bottles their pineapple at 70 proof. With that (and all the mixers) this mimosa mixes up to a pleasant strength. On average, its alcohol content should be just 13 percent ABV (26 proof), or equivalent to the wine on its own.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pineapple-mimosa-recipe-759091

A small spoon lets them enjoy the sherbet as well.\nIf possible, use shaved, cracked, or chipped ice rather than large cubes. The smaller ice particles tend to work better with the sherbet and make the cocktail easier to drink.\nYou can even skip the ice completely if you like. However, it does form a nice base for the sherbet to rest on.\nIf you have an ice-cream maker, raspberry sherbet is incredibly easy to make. Simply combine 3 cups of fresh or frozen (partially thawed) raspberries, 1 1/2 cups of milk, 3/4 cup of white sugar, and a splash of lemon juice in a blender. Blend until smooth then pour it into your ice-cream maker. Use the 25-minute ice cream setting and soon you'll have a quart of raspberry sherbet.\nRecipe Variations\nNo raspberry sherbet? Almost any flavor of sherbet will do, so feel free to use what you have or can find at the store. Regular ice cream will work great as well.\nSwitch from UV Blue to Hpnotiq or blue cura?ao if you like. You can then use any vodka you have in stock while retaining the cocktail's color. It won't have the full raspberry flavor, but the fruity combination is still delicious.\nHow Strong Is the UV?\nBy vodka standards, UV Blue is relatively mild, bottled at just 30 percent ABV (60 proof). Since it's the only alcohol in the drink, the UV liberty is a low-proof drink and tends to have an alcohol content around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/uv-liberty-recipe-cocktail-759108

If you use milk, the drink will be a little thinner and cream will make a slightly thicker cocktail. Either will work and you could even use a scoop of vanilla ice cream.\nTo make this drink a little more dessert-like, place the glass in the freezer after rimming it while you blend up the cocktail.\nIt\'s easy to crush hard candy using a mortar and pestle. You can also place it in a plastic zipper bag and roll over it with a rolling pin or whack it with your muddler. The goal is to get it as fine as possible so it\'s relatively uniform and will be easier to coat the rim.\nRecipe Variations\nThis is a really fun recipe to play with and there are a lot of possibilities. Use it as inspiration and get creative with what you toss in the blender!\nPour any other sweet vodka you like. Pinnacle has fun options like Chocolate Whipped and Cake Vodka. Other vodka brands have similar options like Smirnoff Fluffed Marshmallow and Kissed Caramel or Veil\'s Gingerbread Vodka. For a more ""standard"" vodka option, vanilla is a great choice.\nAdd a few sliced strawberries or other berries to the blender to give it a fresh fruit twist. Banana and pineapple would be fun, too.\nDrizzle a little chocolate syrup on top of the drink or add 1/2 ounce of white cr?me de cacao to the blend for a sweet touch.\nHow Strong Is a Floating on Cloud 9 Cocktail?\nAs with most frozen cocktails, this one is a low-proof drink.

Within a few minutes, the grenadine will settle to the bottom (like the tequila sunrise). Be sure to make this in front of your guests so they get to experience it before it\'s gone. Also, don\'t stir it or the cocktail will become a muddy brown?it will taste ok but doesn\'t look spectacular.\nShaking pineapple juice creates a foam on top of the cocktail and the cream will contribute to that as well. This will settle after a few minutes. Take advantage of it when drizzling the grenadine and you\'ll have a ""bloody snow"" look.\nFeel free to use milk, half and half, or regular cream. Each will produce a slightly different cocktail: milk is the lightest and cream the heaviest.\nRecipe Variations\nAny citrus vodka will work just fine in this cocktail, though there will be subtle differences.\nSwitch out the flavored vodka entirely. Coconut is a natural choice for this recipe, though some of the berry flavors would be excellent as well. You can even go with a clear, unflavored vodka if you like.\nRum is another good option and you can find that spirit infused with citrus fruits as well.\nPour RumChata rather than Irish cream if you\'d like to use a cream liqueur. It has a more neutral base and color and is the better substitute for the recipe\'s cream.\nHow Strong Is a Vampire\'s Kiss?\nThe vampire\'s kiss may have a wicked look, but it a surprisingly gentle cocktail. When you use the recommended brands, its alcohol content mixes up to 9 percent ABV (18 proof) or so.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWhite cr?me de cacao can be used instead of the dark liqueur without affecting the taste. Typically, one is chosen over the other to control a drink's color, but this recipe is filled with dark ingredients so either chocolate liqueur will work.\nPackaged bacon bits work perfectly fine for the garnish.\nYou can also fry or oven-bake bacon until it's really crispy. Let the cooked bacon cool, then chop it up into tiny bits using a food processor. They can be stored in the freezer and used whenever you need them.\nRecipe Variations\nBlend this drink up with other flavors of ice cream. Chocolate's a natural choice, though you can have fun with options that swirl fudge or add nuts to vanilla as well.\nWhen adding ingredients to the blender, hold the beer. After pouring the blended mix, use it to top the boozy ice cream, similar to a root beer float. Be sure to pour the beer slowly so you don't have a foamy mess!\nInstead of spiced rum, try this recipe with salted caramel moonshine for a fun twist. Look for the flavor from brands like Ole Smoky Moonshine and Firefly Distillery.\nHow Strong Is a Twist and Shout?\nLike most blended cocktails, the twist and shout may be filled with alcoholic beverages, but all the extras bring the strength down significantly.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe Vodka. As with most vodka martinis, it's recommended to use a premium brand of vodka because this martini deserves a great vodka. After all, this is a once-a-year drink and if you go to the trouble of making the lilac syrup, you might as well do it up right.\nYou may also want to try a flavored vodka for this cocktail. Any citrus vodka should work quite well and strawberry vodka may also be a good option. When playing with the lilac syrup I found that it pairs wonderfully with strawberries, so give it a try!\nThe Lilacs. It's very likely that this may be your first taste of lilacs and you will be pleasantly surprised. The purple flower has a flavor similar to lavender, though it's a bit more floral like rose water. It's a fun and unique taste and will vary slightly based on the variety of lilac you choose to forage.\nThe Lemon. The homemade syrup and premium vodka call for the best lemon juice you can buy and that comes directly from the fruit itself. For drinks like this with such a transparent flavor and simple ingredient list, taking the time to juice a few lemons will do wonders for the final taste. Before squeezing your lemons, cut a few lemon spirals for garnishes. Twist the spirals and store them in ice water in the refrigerator until your martini's ready.\nWhile you're at it, juice a few extra lemons and use the lilac syrup to make a floral homemade lemonade. It's fantastic and a spring delight the entire family can enjoy.\nHow Strong is the Lilac Lemon Drop Martini?\nAs far as vodka martinis go, the Lilac Lemon Drop Martini is average to below average when it comes to the alcohol content. This is because the shot of vodka is the only liquor, so the cocktail comes in around 18 percent ABV (36 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lilac-lemon-drop-martini-759247

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAny style of sherry will be nice in this cocktail. The fortified wine ranges from the dry profile of fino sherry to a richer (still dry) oloroso to sweet sherry. Explore the options and how they pair with dry vermouth to find a suitable match for your taste. Some people may enjoy oloroso and the sweeter sherries, while others may prefer a dry fino. You may also want to change it up with different food pairings.\nTo ensure the best tasting bamboo cocktail, make sure your fortified wines are fresh. Once open, vermouth has a shelf life of two to three months and sherry is right around two weeks. Both should be stored in the refrigerator.\nIf you can, don\'t skip the lemon spritz or olive garnish. While they may seem like insignificant additions, just like the bitters, the flavors they impart have an impact on the bamboo cocktail\'s finished taste.\nRecipe Variation\nJust like the martini, you can make this mix ""perfect"" by using equal parts of sweet and dry vermouth. The resulting cocktail is called the Adonis, another classic from the late 1800s.\nHow Strong Is a Bamboo Cocktail?\nThe other advantage of the bamboo cocktail over the gin martini is how light it is, which makes it an ideal dinner companion. Taking the average of the two wines, it should have an alcohol content around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nLondon dry gin is the preferred style for the monkey gland.\nFresh-squeezed orange juice is highly recommended. The average orange should yield enough juice for two to three drinks.\nIf you\'re making a single monkey gland, juice half the orange and use the other half for the orange slice garnish.\nWhen opting for the orange peel, cut it from the whole fruit before juicing. Use a pairing knife to cut a thick strip about 2 inches long. To flame it, hold the peel over the glass, light a match, and gently express the oils through the flame and into the drink; you\'ll see little sparks.\nRecipe Variation\nThe monkey gland appears in numerous 20th-century bartending guides, and each has subtle differences. Some use just a dash or two of grenadine or a little more orange juice, and many recommend shaking the drink with cracked ice. You might find these adjustments a better fit as you explore different styles and brands of gin.\nDuring the time that absinthe was illegal in the U.S., many bartenders learned to make this drink with B?n?dictine. It is an excellent drink as well, though it has an entirely different profile.\nWho Created the Monkey Gland Cocktail?\nIn his 1922 ""Harry\'s ABC of Mixing Cocktails"" book, Harry MacElhone took credit for the monkey gland\'s invention. MacElhone was one of the many American bartenders who left during Prohibition. He ran Harry\'s New York Bar in Paris, France, where he created numerous famous cocktails, including the French 75 and bloody mary. His bartending guides are a fantastic reference for classic cocktail recipes.\nWhy Is It Called the Monkey Gland?\nMacElhone claimed that the experiments of Dr. Serge Voronoff inspired the name. In the 1920s, the surgeon focused on male enhancement treatments, the most famous of which involved grafting monkey testicle tissue (or monkey glands) to human testicles. Voronoff became well-known for this rather shocking technique and received a considerable amount of ridicule. He died in near obscurity in the 1950s. His boldness lives on in the name of this cocktail as well as monkey gland sauce, which was reportedly created by French chefs working in South Africa.\nHow Strong Is a Monkey Gland?\nThe monkey gland is a stiff drink. On average, its alcohol content should fall around 22 percent ABV (44 proof). That\'s about the same as a cosmopolitan, though this drink promises to be a lot more fun.\n15 Prohibition-Era Cocktails']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/monkey-gland-cocktail-recipe-759322

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nTo be a traditionalist, use Old Tom Gin like that produced by Hayman\'s.\nRecipe Variations\nSome recipes replace the maraschino liqueur with dry vermouth and/or Cointreau or triple sec.\nThe classic Emerson cocktail is very similar. To make it, shake 2 ounces gin, 1 ounce sweet vermouth, 1/2 ounce lemon juice, and 1/2 ounce maraschino.\nHow Strong Is the Martinez?\nAs you might imagine with a cocktail made entirely of liquor, the Martinez is not a low-proof cocktail. Drinks of this style never are.\n\nIf using a 30-proof vermouth, 80-proof gin, and 64-proof maraschino, you can estimate that the Martinez has an alcohol content of about 31 percent ABV (62 proof). That is not a light cocktail, so take it easy.\nThe Martinez as the Father of the Martini\nYou cannot have a discussion about the history of the martini without speaking of the Martinez. The Martinez came first.\nIt is widely accepted that the Martinez had a direct influence on the creation of the martini. A few accounts of the Martini\'s origin refer to Martinez, California where a plaque still marks the occasion. This town had an obvious and direct influence on naming the Martinez cocktail.\nThe Martinez recipe is old. It was first printed in the 1887 edition of ""The Bon Vivant\'s Companion: Or How to Mix Drinks"" by Professor Jerry Thomas. It is Thomas who is credited with creating this sweet drink while working in California for a patron traveling to (where else?) Martinez.\nAccording to ""The Joy of Mixology"" by Gary (Gaz) Regan, Thomas\' Martinez was heavy on vermouth, light on the gin, and called for Boker\'s bitters, which is no longer available (Angostura is a great substitute). Add a little maraschino and a lemon twist and you have a great, often overlooked, sweetened gin cocktail.\nIn his book, Regan refers to the Martinez as ""born of the Manhattan...and is the father, or perhaps grandfather, of the Dry Gin Martini."" This statement would allude to the possibility that the Manhattan begat the Martinez, which begat the martini. The martini just happened to have emerged as the most popular of the three.\nCocktail origins are always a little hazy and have some mystery, so you may never be absolutely sure. However, today\'s cocktail historians are very good at deciphering and decoding the past and it is a good chance that they are correct on this one.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/martinez-cocktail-recipe-759324

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo thicken a frozen cocktail, add an ice cube or two and blend again. If it's too thick, add a little more lime juice.\nFor a depth of flavor, use raw sugar (e.g., turbinado or demerara) or coconut sugar instead of white sugar in the simple syrup recipe. Honey and agave nectar are good alternative sweeteners.\nSince lime is the featured ingredient, fresh lime juice really is best in this recipe. The average lime yields 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce; you can typically squeeze two whole limes into the blender.\nStemmed glassware is an excellent choice for frozen daiquiris because you can hold the glass without warming the drink. It works just as well in a tall collins glass or stout tumbler.\nNo matter which glass you use, chill it first. A few minutes in the freezer will keep your daiquiri from melting too quickly.\nRecipe Variations\nSkip the rum and triple sec for a virgin daiquiri. Add more lime juice or replace the liquors with coconut water.\nThis recipe is the basis for a variety of frozen daiquiris, and almost any fruit will complement the lime. Pineapple or strawberry rum add instant intrigue. You can also infuse herbs like rosemary, lavender, or mint into a syrup or rum.\nAnother option is to add a liqueur. Taking a hint from the Hemingway daiquiri, a shot of maraschino is a nice boost; the frozen version is sometimes called a Floridita daiquiri. Other lightly flavored liqueurs (e.g., elderflower, lychee, vanilla) are fun, too.\nFor a big change in flavor, add your favorite fresh or frozen fruits to the blender. Like the banana daiquiri, cut the fruit into chunks for easier blending or let frozen fruits thaw a bit. Don't be afraid of mixing flavors: pineapple-kiwi, strawberry-banana, apricot-peach... The combinations are endless.\nWhat Is the Best Rum for a Frozen Daiquiri?\nWhile white rum may be a good choice for a full-flavored strawberry daiquiri, a lime daiquiri needs a little more dimension. This is the perfect time to use your favorite gold or aged rum. For even more flavor, consider a spiced or flavored rum. The drink's more transparent flavor will not cover up any impurities in the rum, either. For the best-tasting frozen daiquiri, choose a mid-range brand of rum.\nCan Frozen Daquiris Be Made Ahead?\nWhile you have the blender going, make multiple daiquiris at once and freeze them to enjoy later. Pour the finished cocktail into freezer-safe glass jars, filling each no more than 3/4 full to allow for expansion and prevent broken glass. They'll keep well for up to a month. Set the jars out for 10 to 15 minutes to thaw a bit, and stir before drinking. Use 1/2-pint jars for single-serving daiquiris or larger containers when preparing for a party and scoop the slushy into glasses.\nWhat's the Difference Between a Daiquiri and Margarita?\nThough very similar and equally customizable, the primary difference between a daiquiri and margarita is the base liquor. Daiquiris use rum, and margaritas are made with tequila. Typically, the daiquiri doesn't use triple sec, which is standard in a margarita, but sometimes (as in this recipe), it's a nice addition to the rum cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Frozen Lime Daiquiri?\nAs with most blended cocktails, the frozen daiquiri is a light drink.

Stir well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lime wedge or slice. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSome lime cordials are sweeter, while others are quite tart; it\'s best to adjust the drink to your personal taste and the cordial you\'re pouring. Gimlet ratios range from 3 parts gin to 1 part lime cordial (similar to this recipe) to 5 parts gin to 1 part lime cordial.\nIf you want to stay traditional, opt for Plymouth Gin (suggested in the 1930 ""The Savoy Cocktail Book"") or a premium London dry gin. Or put a modern twist on this old favorite and explore the array of gins available. For instance, a pour of the cucumber-forward Hendrick\'s or the mint, citrus, and spice profile of The Botanist can be really interesting.\nFor a tart kick, wipe the rim with the lime wedge, gently squeeze it over the drink, then drop it in.\nRecipe Variations\nStirring is the traditional mixing method for the gimlet, though many modern-day recipes call for shaking the drink. This aerates and softens the drink\'s flavor.\nServe it on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass.\nSubstitute the gin with vodka for a vodka gimlet.\nSkip the lime cordial and pour equal parts of fresh lime juice and simple syrup. Begin with 1/2 ounce pour of each and adjust to taste.\nIn the book ""Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails,"" Ted Haigh (Dr. Cocktail) suggests pouring 1/2 ounce each of Rose\'s and fresh lime juice to reduce the gimlet\'s sweetness.\nHow Do You Pronounce the Gimlet Cocktail?\nWhile you might be inclined to say it similar to gin (jin), the gimlet cocktail uses a hard ""g."" Gimlet is pronounced as gim-luht, where the ""g"" sounds like one in gimmick.\nWhy Is It Called a Gimlet?\nThere are two possible origins to the gimlet cocktail\'s name, and they\'re both connected to the 19th-century British navy. One points to a naval surgeon, Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas D. Gimlette. He made a scurvy treatment of lime juice more appealing by adding gin (sailors who had rum drank navy grog). The other account refers to the tool; a gimlet is used to bore holes in wood, and it\'s said that sailors used it to gain access to liquor barrels. In either instance, Rose\'s Lime Cordial likely came into use because it was the first fruit juice concentrate (released in 1867). Using the preserved juice ensured sailors received their required daily ration of lime.\nGin Gimlet vs. Gin Rickey\nWhile the gin gimlet uses lime cordial or lime juice, whichever you prefer, the gin rickey adds club soda into the mix.\nHow Strong Is the Gimlet?\nThe gimlet is not a weak drink. The lime cordial makes it a little gentler than the 62-proof martini, but this cocktail can still sneak up on you. If you pour it according to the recipe, with an 80-proof gin, the gimlet mixes up to about 24 percent alcohol by volume (48 proof).\nClassic Cocktails Every Drinker Should Try']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/gimlet-cocktail-recipe-759304

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with the lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nOnly the Best Ingredients, Please\nThere's one thing that you will quickly learn with simple cocktails like this: The better the ingredients, the better the drink. It seems logical but sometimes we get in the mindset of saving money and the quality of our drinks can suffer.\nBeing a little cheap may be OK for some mixed drinks. This is particularly true when the spirits are covered by heavy mixers like fruit juices and cola. However, this style of cocktail deserves your best. That's not to say that you have to spend a fortune on the brandy and rum. A slight upgrade and careful decisions will give you a great drink.\nFor instance, think twice before pouring the same rum you use for your Rum & Coke into a Between the Sheets. This drink deserves a rum that can stand on its own. Can you drink it straight without cringing? If so, then you have a good candidate. The same applies to the brandy.\nWhen it comes to triple sec, be very, very careful. It's easy to pick up that really inexpensive bottle, but many of those are super syrupy and will bring down the entire drink. Fork over a few extra bucks for Cointreau or Luxardo. You can even use a good cura?ao in its place.\nKeeping a quality triple sec in your bar will prove to be an invaluable upgrade to countless cocktails. From the Margarita to the Daiquiri, many of the most popular drink recipes rely on it. Quite often, they're just as simple as the Between the Sheets, so it's vital that you choose wisely.\nAs with any sour drink, we have to reiterate the power that fresh lemon juice has in this cocktail. Stocking a few lemons at all times will give you high-quality cocktails every time.\nHow Strong Is the Between the Sheets?\nIf you were to pour an 80-proof brandy and rum with a 60-proof triple sec, you will have a cocktail that's around 28 percent ABV (56 proof). That is why drinks like this are served at just 3 to 4 ounces at a time.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/between-the-sheets-cocktail-recipe-759286

You want to enhance the fruits with the rum, not bring them down.\nLikewise, it's best to invest a little more money into a quality triple sec. Many of the cheapest options are too syrupy or have an artificial orange flavor that will not work well in this drink. Besides that, triple sec is one of the most used liqueurs in the bar and an upgrade will improve all of your daiquiris and margaritas.\nFresh lime juice is highly recommended to create the best-tasting beachcomber. You should get enough juice from one lime for one or two drinks.\nServing the beachcomber in a chilled glass will keep the drink colder to the very last sip.\nRecipe Variations\nThe beachcomber is such a popular cocktail that it has been remade many times over the years. Beyond the frozen cocktail option, there are other flavors that you can add to the drink.\nOne frozen version of this drink uses 2 ounces light rum, 3/4 ounce each triple sec and lime juice, and 2 dashes of maraschino liqueur. Blend it with 1 cup of ice and 1/4 teaspoon simple syrup if desired.\nA common variation is to replace the light rum with equal parts of coconut rum and vodka. You could also keep the light rum and split it with coconut vodka (C?roc makes a fabulous one).\nAdd a splash of banana liqueur if you like.\nCherry brandy, Cherry Heering, and other cherry-flavored liqueurs are often used as substitutes for the maraschino. Each of these options will result in a slightly sweeter drink and it will be best to skip the optional syrup.\nHow Strong Is a Beachcomber?\nWith three liquors and one nonalcoholic mixer, you can expect the beachcomber to be a strong drink. It will typically have an alcohol content in the 26 percent ABV (52 proof) range. That's equivalent to the average martini and the reason why it's served just over 4 ounces.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/beachcomber-cocktail-recipe-759281

While you have the sugar, dip half a lemon slice in it as well, gently shaking off any excess sugar.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the tequila, melon liqueur, triple sec, sour mix, and orange juice. Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into the prepared glass.\nAdd a splash of lime juice and garnish with a sugar-coated lemon. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThere are a number of options on the market for lime-infused tequila because it's a popular margarita ingredient. Some are actual infusions of lime while others are sweetened, turning them into tequila liqueurs. Look for bottles like Dulce Vida Lime Tequila, Hornitos Lime Shot, and Patron Citr?nge Lime Liqueur.\nAnother option is to do your own infusion. Use 2 or 3 limes, rinsed and cut into wedges for a full bottle of tequila. The infusion should take three to four days, though you'll want to check it and let it infuse longer until it reaches your desired flavor.\nFresh-squeezed citrus juices will give this cocktail the punch of tartness that it needs. For the lime, you can even simply squeeze a wedge over the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nThis margarita can also be served on the rocks or blended with 1 cup of ice.\nYou could always use a non-flavored tequila, though it's a good idea to increase the lime juice a little bit.\nHow Strong Is a Sour Patch Margarita?\nTypical for a shaken margarita, this cocktail's alcohol content should fall in the 19 percent ABV (36 proof) range. That's almost half the strength of a straight shot of tequila. While the sweet-tart taste may tempt you to drink more if you want to avoid a hangover that may not be the best idea.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sour-patch-margarita-760868

It will keep for about 1 week.\nMake the Red Pepper Sangrita Margarita\nGather the ingredients.\nCombine the tequila and pepper mix with ice in a cocktail shaker.\nRoll the contents from one shaker into another five times. Alternatively, stir or shake the cocktail.\nStrain into a chilled margarita glass.\nGarnish with a lime wedge or red pepper slice. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs written, the pepper mix recipe makes about 20 ounces, enough for 8 of these margaritas.\nIncrease or decrease the batch as needed. Keep the ratio at 3 parts tomato juice to 1 part each of the pepper puree and sour mix, add the hot sauce, then make adjustments to any of the ingredients.\nThe red pepper puree is not meant to be spicy (the Tabasco takes care of that). Instead, make it with red bell peppers (it may also be found at stores). If you want it a little spicier, toss in a chile pepper.\nTo make 1 cup of roasted red pepper puree, roast 2 red bell peppers on a foil-lined pan in a 500 F oven for 30 to 40 minutes, flipping the peppers every 10 minutes. Once the peppers collapse, remove from the oven and let cool. Remove the stem, skin, seeds, and core from each pepper, then place in a food processor. Blend with a pinch of salt and drizzle in about 1/4 cup of olive oil. It will store in the refrigerator for up to a week or the freezer for a month under a tight seal.\nPlastic containers may soak up the spices and can leave behind residual odors or flavors. It's best to store this mix in a non-porous container like glass.\nThe pepper mix also makes a good bloody mary base and can be used as a sangrita chaser.\nHow Strong Is a Red Pepper Sangrita Margarita?\nThis margarita definitely packs more of a flavor punch than an alcohol bite. Its alcohol content is relatively mild, weighing in somewhere around 13 percent ABV (26 proof), or about the strength of a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-pepper-sangrita-margarita-760865

Then wet the rim with a piece of citrus fruit by running it around the edge.\nRoll the wet rim in the cocoa sugar to get an even coat all the way around. Tap off any excess.\nIn a blender, add the ice, tequila, chocolate liqueur, cream, and bitters. Squeeze in a splash each of lime and orange juices.\nBlend until smooth.\nPour into the prepared glass.\nTop with chocolate shavings. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFive or six average-sized ice cubes is equivalent to 1 cup of ice. Add these first to ensure the blender's blades chop them up quickly.\nFor the chocolate liqueur, indulge with the creamiest, most chocolatey spirit that you can find. Godiva, Dorda, and Mozart are a few brands worth exploring. Dark cr?me de cacao, like that from Bols, is an excellent choice as well.\nAdding the citrus juices is as easy as squeezing half of the fruit into the blender. Don't squeeze the entire orange, though, as that can add up to an ounce or more; just a short squeeze will do unless you're making two margaritas at once.\nRecipe Variations\nThis margarita can also be shaken using the same ingredients, except for the ice. It is best, however, when served on the rocks.\nAdd chocolate swirls to the glass. To do this, place your rimmed margarita glass in the freezer for a few minutes so it gets nice and frosty. Take it out and swirl chocolate syrup inside, then place it back in the freezer while you blend the drink. Your glass will be cold and the swirls will suspend on the sides and slowly melt into the drink.\nA creamy white chocolate liqueur (Mozart and Godiva offer one) will work wonders here because it plays nicely against the lime.\nIce cream and cream liqueurs (e.g., Irish cream, RumChata) are great alternatives to the cream. For the ice cream option, add one scoop and use half the ice cubes (about 3 or 4 is perfect). Cream liqueurs can simply be poured at the same 1-ounce measurement.\nHow Strong Is a Chocolate Margarita?\nThe majority of frozen cocktails are low-proof drinks because of all the ice. The chocolate margarita is no exception. Its alcohol content should be around 7 percent ABV (14 proof), falling right between beer and wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/chocolate-margarita-760765

It's very easy to make the syrup at home, though, because it simply requires sugar, water, and about 15 minutes of your time. Going that route can cost just a few cents per batch.\nSqueezing a single grapefruit should yield between 5 and 6 ounces of juice. You'll have plenty for multiple drinks, so share the experience with a few friends or store the excess in the refrigerator.\nRecipe Variations\nPour a blanco tequila if you prefer or if it's all you have stocked in your bar. At just 1/2 ounce, the difference is not going to make a huge impact on the cocktail's taste.\nServing this drink up in a cocktail glass is a great way to fancy up the presentation?it makes a great digestif to enjoy after dinner. Chill the glass first to ensure the drink stays cold.\nRather than adding a pinch of salt at the end, rim half the glass with salt. It adds a sort of margarita spin and by only doing half, you can sip from the salted or unsalted side as you see fit.\nHow Strong Is a Fright Night in the Grove Cocktail?\nDespite its delicious taste, you will want to take it easy with this drink because it's pretty potent.

The quickest method is to add a few ice cubes to the glass while you mix the drink (cold soda water helps, too).

However, you may enjoy the slight oaky flavor of the reposado just a little better.\nFresh citrus juices are highly recommended. One lime should produce 1 ounce of juice, perfect for a single drink. Grapefruits typically yield 5 or 6 ounces, so you'll have more than enough for a few drinks.\nEnsure that the triple sec you pour is equal in quality to the tequila. Cointreau is one of the most popular premium options, and other types of orange liqueur, including cura?ao, can be used as well.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch back to grapefruit soda if you like. Squirt and Fanta are the most common options, though Izze, Jarritos, Q Drinks, and many other companies offer the flavor as well.\nRather than aromatic bitters (Angostura), go all out on the citrus by accenting the drink with orange or grapefruit bitters instead.\nThis is a great drink to mix up by the pitcher and serve at a cookout or other small gathering. Simply multiply the ingredients by the number of servings you need, keeping them in proportion. If you're making it up ahead of time to store in the refrigerator, hold the soda until you're ready to serve so it doesn't go flat.

Add as much as you like to the muddle because more papaya will not hurt this drink! Be sure to remove the peel. The seeds have a strong mustard-peppercorn flavor, so avoid getting those into your drink. For the garnish, try a few papaya balls (scooped out with a melon baller) rather than a slice.\nIf you're going to use another tequila, make sure it's top-shelf. This cocktail really deserves the best tequila you can afford to pour. A reposado tequila would be a good substitute for the a?ejo, though blanco tequilas may be too transparent.\nFresh-squeezed citrus juices are highly recommended for this cocktail. One orange will yield 2 to 3 ounces, more than enough for a few drinks. For the lime, you'll need about one lime per cocktail and can even simply squeeze two halves directly into the cocktail shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nTransform this drink into a frozen cocktail by combining the ingredients with 1 cup of ice (about 5 or 6 ice cubes) in a blender.\nMake this drink with other tropical fruit, either with papaya or as a substitute. Mango and pineapple would both be fun options that can add a nice spark to the cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Papaya Smash?\nThe papaya smash is a perfectly balanced cocktail for a casual occasion. It's neither too strong nor too light but falls right in the middle. Its alcohol content is around 15 percent ABV (30 proof), making it similar to drinking a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/papaya-smash-recipe-760778

Also, the herbs and pepper are flavorful enough to handle a larger volume of pineapple juice. For this reason, the chaser is designed to make two 1 1/2-ounce servings. Make even more at once if you like.\nStore any leftover chaser in the refrigerator for no more than one day. It's best in a sealed glass jar; it may be difficult to remove the herb/pepper aroma and flavor from a more porous container like plastic. Wash your blender pitcher out very well as soon as possible.\nRecipe Variations\nPour this shot with a blanco or even a?ejo tequila if you prefer.\nThere's no need to actually shoot this drink if you don't want to. It's an interesting experience when taken slowly as small sips?one of tequila and one of the chaser.\nIf you don't like cilantro (some people find that it tastes like soap), try another green leafy herb instead. Basil and oregano will each offer a nice herbal background to the mint and pepper without cilantro's distinct taste.\nHow Strong Is an El Vocho Shot?\nIn theory, if you were going to mix the tequila with the chaser, you would be cutting the strength of the tequila in half. That would make the 80-proof Milagro Reposado a 40-proof (20 percent ABV) shot. However, you're actually just giving your stomach a buffer to the alcohol (and a spicy one at that). This can slow down the effects of the tequila, but if you drink one too many rounds, you'll be on the road to a pretty nasty hangover (and potential upset stomach).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/el-vocho-shooter-recipe-760772

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe sour mix is very easy to make at home and is nothing more than lemon-lime-flavored simple syrup. You can control the flavor to suit your taste, and it's much better tasting and cheaper than buying those sugary sour mixes at the liquor store.\nFresh lime juice is also highly recommended. The average lime yields between 1/2 and 1 ounce of juice, so you can easily get one or two margaritas out of a single fruit.\nIf you have an electric juicer, grab a fresh pineapple. You'll want it for the garnish, anyway. It will produce a superior coco margarita to one made with canned pineapple juice.\nPineapples are so juicy that you can even muddle chunks to extract the juice without a juicer. It takes a little more work, but it's one of the easier fruits to juice by hand. Simply strain out the chunks of pineapple through a fine mesh strainer, pressing it to get as much juice as possible. Squeezing it in a cheesecloth bundle can also maximize your juice yield.\nChoose Your Tequila\nAs with all margaritas, the tequila you choose to pour will enhance the flavor of the coco margarita. Since it does have such strong flavors, you don't have to pour your best tequila, but it should be one of a decent quality.\nFor a margarita like this, a good blanco (or silver) tequila is a great way to go. These unaged tequilas have a neutral flavor that's similar to rum, though it's not sweet. Instead, you get that great earthy flavor that is a signature of tequila.\nBlanco tequilas also tend to be the most affordable. If you have a favorite brand, you can typically expect to pay $10 less for the blanco than you would for the slightly aged reposado. Yet, there is something to be said for adding that slight oak flavor to the coconut-pineapple mix. It's intriguing and worth trying at least once.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you like, this margarita can be blended. Simply pour the ingredients into a blender with about 1 cup ice (5 or 6 ice cubes). Add more ice or cream of coconut if it's not quite as thick as you like.\nHow Strong Is a Coco Margarita?\nThe coco margarita is one of the lightest shaken margaritas you can mix up because tequila is the only liquor in the recipe. Though it will vary slightly, this drink should have an alcohol content around 13 percent ABV (26 proof). That's comparable to a glass of wine, only the margarita is far more delicious.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/coco-margarita-recipe-760808

It doesn't have to be your best tequila, but something in the middle. While a blanco tequila is a great option, reposados tend to add an extra dimension that is quite nice.\nFor the tamarind nectar, Jumex is probably the most popular brand and you can often find it in the soda or juice aisle of many grocers.\nWhile fresh pineapple juice is preferred, you can easily get away with canned juice for this recipe, which makes it a little easier.\nThe splash of lime juice brings all the flavors together and completes the drink. All you need to do is squeeze the juice from a lime wedge into the blender.\nTo make the cinnamon sugar, mix 3 parts sugar to 1 part ground cinnamon until you get a uniform brown color. Adjust the ratio to taste.\nRecipe Variations\nChili powder or Tajin Seasoning are other great options for the rim. Either pair really well with tamarind and are very interesting with pineapple.\nSkip the blender and shake this margarita instead. Simply pour all the liquids into a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake well, and strain into the glass.\nHow Strong Is a Tamarind-Pineapple Margarita?\nFrozen cocktails tend to be low-proof drinks and this margarita is no exception. Its alcohol content will fall somewhere around 9 percent ABV (18 proof), placing it right between beer and wine. If you choose to shake it, you'll have a stronger drink of 14 percent ABV (28 proof), which is still nearly half that of the original margarita.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tamarind-pineapple-margarita-recipe-760788

The color of the options varies greatly, from clear spirits like Soho and Bols to a pale pink like Fruko Shulz, Giffard Lichi-Li, and Kwai Feh, and the brilliant red of Lichido. Which you choose will determine the color of your shots.\nAlternatively, you can make your own lychee liqueur. It simply requires some lychee fruit, lime zest, and simple syrup. While that recipe uses a vodka base, tequila is an excellent option.\nThis recipe yields a 2-ounce shot, so you will need a tall shot glass. You can also divide it into two smaller glasses if that's the only option.\nRecipe Variations\nBlanco (or silver) tequila is typically poured into this shot, though the slight aging of reposado tequila adds a nice depth of flavor.\nWhile often poured in equal amounts, feel free to pour a little more of either ingredient to suit your taste. If you like things a little sweeter and softer, go with 1 ounce of lychee liqueur and 1/2 ounce of tequila. Reverse that if you want the tequila to dominate the shot.\nThis shot is also a good option for vodka if you prefer that over tequila.\nAdd a little boost of flavor by squeezing a lime wedge into the shaker. For bottled lime juice, just a splash will do.\nThere's no need to relegate this combination to shot glasses. If you like the taste of the lychee tequila, make it a little larger and take some time to sip and savor the taste. Serve it on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass or up as a martini.\nHow Strong Is a Lychee Tequila Shot?\nThe majority of lychee liqueurs are around 40 proof. Combining that with an 80-proof tequila and factoring in a little ice dilution, this shot shakes up to 20 percent ABV (40 proof). That's a very strong shot and half the strength of drinking the tequila straight.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/crouching-tiger-shooter-760811

Wet an adjoining third of the glass with the lime and roll it in white sugar. Repeat with the last third of the rim, this time rolling it in red sugar.\nIn a mixing glass or cocktail shaker filled with ice, pour the tequila and fruit juices.\nStir well, then squeeze in the juice from a lime wedge, and stir again.\nStrain the drink into the rimmed glass and add a splash of soda.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you want to serve this cocktail over ice, it's best to use fresh ice in the glass. The ice used to mix the drink will be broken down from agitation and dilute the drink faster.\nWhite cranberry juice is preferred for this cocktail because it's slightly less sweet than the more popular red cranberry juice. Either will work fine, though.\nColored sugars are often available at cake decorating stores or in a grocer's baking section.\nIf you want to make your own green and red sugar, it's easy though you'll need to plan ahead. Simply add four or five drops of food coloring to 1/8 cup of sugar. Mix with a fork until the sugar becomes a consistent color. Lay the sugar out in a flat pile on wax paper overnight to dry, then break it back up into fine granules before rimming the glass.\nHow Strong Is a Cinco Herradura?\nThe Cinco Herradura is a mild cocktail compared to the average margarita.

Infuse longer if needed, tasting it daily until it reaches your desired intensity.\nStrain out the fruits and bottle the flavored tequila. Store like any other liquor.\nTips\nUse a wide-mouthed jar for the infusion to make adding and removing the fruit easier.\nMason jars are a good choice that can be reused. A 32-ounce (1-quart) jar is the minimum size for a full bottle of tequila and the fruits.\nBecause of the kiwi's tiny seeds and small raspberry pieces, you may need to strain this infusion through a fine-mesh strainer. You can also strain it a few times or use cheesecloth to remove all the fruity bits.\nMake the Gummy Bear Margarita\nGather the ingredients.\nRim a chilled margarita glass with sugar, fill with ice and gummy bears.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the tequila, watermelon liqueur, triple sec, sour mix, cranberry juice, and grenadine. Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into the prepared glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nRecipe Variation\nThis margarita can be served up without ice or blended with 1 cup of ice.\nIf you choose to use the non-flavored tequila option, consider bringing back the kiwi and raspberry flavors with additional ingredients. For instance, you can use a raspberry liqueur or syrup in place of the grenadine or split it with the cranberry juice. To add kiwi, muddle a few slices of the fruit with the sour mix before shaking everything together.\nAs an alternative to Watermelon Pucker, try another melon-flavored liqueur. Midori is a great choice and there are similar options from brands like Bols.\nHow Strong Is a Gummy Bear Margarita?\nThis margarita is lighter than many recipes and just slightly stronger than a glass of wine.

Choose a good mid-range brand that you wouldn't mind drinking straight.\nAs with any dairy cocktail, you can adjust the frostbite's creaminess with your choice of cream. For the richest drink, go with regular cream. Milk will produce a light drink, or you can split the difference and pour half and half.\nA white chocolate liqueur is a good substitute for cr?me de cacao and won't affect the cocktail's color. Look for it from brands like Godiva and Mozart.\nRecipe Variations\nStrain this drink into a chilled cocktail glass for a frostbite martini if you prefer. Just be sure your glass is nice and frosty. Vodka can replace the tequila as well.\nPlay around with the ratio of the ingredients to find your perfect mix. Some frostbite recipes pour equal amounts of the liqueurs and cream (1/2 ounce each). Others add just a splash of cream, while some people prefer up to 2 ounces of cream.\nYou can also bring a little mint into your frostbite by adding 1/4 ounce of white cr?me de menthe or peppermint schnapps. Most people enjoy this version with a lot of cream.\nRather than dairy cream, pour a cream liqueur instead; either Irish cream or RumChata are excellent choices. You can also go with a dairy alternative such as soy or almond milk.\nHow Strong Is a Frostbite Cocktail?\nThe frostbite definitely has a bite to it! Surprisingly, this cocktail's alcohol content is right up there with martinis, weighing in around 26 percent ABV (52 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIt's not recommended that you eat the pepper when the drink is gone. However, washing your hands after handling it is a wise move. Definitely, don't touch your eyes or face before doing so!\nThere's no need to cut the pepper because it will infuse the martini perfectly when left whole. Keep in mind that most of the heat from any chili pepper is in the capsaicin-holding white flesh inside. If you cut a slit in it or cut it in half, the liquid will touch this and become spicier more quickly.\nOnce you find that the habanero martini hits your ideal flavor, remove the pepper to prevent the flavor from developing further. This is a particularly good idea if you tend to take your time enjoying the drink.\nAny other hot chili pepper can be used instead of the habanero. Jalape?o is a popular choice and Thai chili peppers can really give it a boost.\nIt's best to avoid any peppers that are hotter than the habanero on the Scoville Scale?sorry, no ghost peppers. They are simply too hot and do not make a pleasant drinking experience. Daring yourself to sip a super hot drink is not fun because it's not like food that offers other ingredients to absorb the heat. It also has the potential to be dangerous by burning your mouth and throat. Besides, you probably won't drink all of it and will just be wasting perfectly good tequila.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you prefer, pour a silver (blanco) tequila rather than a reposado. You will get a very nice drink, though it will not have that oak flavor that comes from barrel aging. \nHow Strong Is the Habanero Martini?\nNot only does this cocktail have the potential to be hot and spicy, but it's also rather potent. It may be best to limit yourself to one per night because the alcohol content is around 27 percent ABV (54 proof) when made with an 80-proof tequila.

Warm the fruit to room temperature if stored in the refrigerator and roll it under the palm of your hand to get the most juice out of your lime.\nMidori may be the best-known melon liqueur and it's one of your best options, but there are others on the market. Bols Melon is another premium brand and Monin makes a pretty good one as well. You can also find this flavor produced by DeKuyper and Hiram Walker.\nTo keep your margarita colder longer, strain the drink into a chilled glass. Either place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're mixing the drink then dump them out or place your glass in the freezer for at least half an hour.\nRecipe Variations\nSince this drink comes out to about 5 1/2 ounces after mixing, it's a perfect candidate to serve on the rocks in one of the smaller Mason jar glasses.\nYou can also blend this margarita with 1 cup of ice for a frozen version.\nSwitch from blanco tequila to a reposado to give your melon margarita a slight hint of oak.\nPick up a bottle of watermelon schnapps and use that instead of the average green melon liqueur.\nAdd a fun twist by infusing your tequila with a complementary flavor. Melon pairs well with any variety of berries, so try raspberry, strawberry, or even blueberry tequila. You can also try something very unique and pour a lemongrass-ginger tequila into this cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Melon Margarita?\nThe sour mix and lime juice make up a large portion of this margarita, so it's not as strong as you might think.

Look for it from brands like Bols and Gabriel Boudier. Malibu makes a fun mango-flavored rum liqueur as well that adds a hint of coconut.\nAdding a sugar rim to the glass is a fantastic idea for any margarita and it's very simple to do.\nTo play off the mango, consider adding some contrast to the rim. Cinnamon sugar is a great option and can be done by mixing equal parts of sugar and ground cinnamon. Another idea is to use something spicy like Tajin Seasoning, which is often used for the tamarind margarita.\n A slice of mango for a garnish is always a nice touch as well.\nRecipe Variations\nWith fresh mangoes, you can make frozen margaritas for two. Begin by peeling and dicing 1 1/2 cups mango and chop them up a little more in the blender with 1 cup of ice. Add 3 ounces blanco tequila, 1 ounce orange liqueur, 2 ounces fresh lime juice, and 2 tablespoons sugar. Blend until smooth then pour into two margarita glasses and garnish each with a lime wheel.\nIf your margarita is too thick, add a little more of one of the liquids and blend again. Too thin? Toss in a few more ice cubes or mango chunks. Make these adjustments in small amounts until you get the perfect consistency for you.\nYou can also blend the ingredients in the shaken mango margarita with 1 cup of ice.\nAdd a dash or two of hot sauce to this margarita to give it a little kick. Mango is the perfect fruit pairing for spicy peppers, so if you're a fan of hot and spicy, give this a try.\nHow Strong Is a Mango Margarita?\nThe shaken mango margarita is going to be significantly stronger than the blended version.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe recipe makes about 12 4-ounce servings and should fit into a 60-ounce pitcher with the ice and fruit. Increase it as needed to fit your party needs.\nFor the tequila and wine, make it really easy by pouring half of a 750 mL bottle of each. Use a full bottle when doubling the recipe.\nYou can also find hibiscus syrup from companies like Monin and Torani. It's not the most popular flavor and may not be stocked in your local store, so you may have to buy it online.\nRecipe Variations\nInstead of club soda, top this punch off with half a bottle of sparkling wine.\nAn alternative to the hibiscus syrup is to pour a hibiscus-infused tequila, as found in the Rosangel margarita. You can keep the syrup for double the floral flavor, switch to plain simple syrup, or use 1/2 cup of white sugar (be sure to stir until it dissolves completely).\nHow Strong Is a Tequila Sangria?\nJust because there's tequila, doesn't mean this is a strong punch. It's actually quite mild, mixing up to 9 percent ABV (18 proof) or so, making it more like a light wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/liquid-lust-recipe-760840

Add a dash of sour mix.\nShake well.\nStrain into a shot glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nEven if you choose to drink it slowly, the shot looks best when served in caballitos (tall, thin shot glasses, traditionally used for straight tequila).\nThe recipe mixes up a 3 1/2-ounce shot and that requires a larger than normal shot glass. Alternatively, split it between two small shot glasses or just pour it into a rocks glass.\nA blanco tequila is an excellent fit for this shot and its clean taste will let the Ty Ku shine.\nYou can purchase sour mix at most liquor stores. Look for it with other nonalcoholic mixers like grenadine and tonic water.\nYou can also make your own sour mix and it's incredibly easy (and cheaper). Essentially, it's a simple syrup that's flavored with lemon and/or lime juice. It's a useful bar ingredient that can be used in sour drinks and margaritas, too.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you cannot find Ty Ku, you can use an orange liqueur, such as triple sec or cura?ao. You won't get the same green color and the taste will change slightly.\nBuild on this tasty drink and serve it so you can enjoy it longer. Strain it into an old-fashioned glass filled with ice or serve it up in a cocktail glass for a funky tequila martini.\nYou can also go with a tall glass and top it with your favorite soda. Ginger ale and citrus sodas are great choices.\nHow Strong Is a Mexican Samurai Shot?\nThis drink may be stunning, but that sweet taste and captivating green glow hide a potent shot. When mixed up, the alcohol content will fall in the 21 percent ABV (42 proof) range. That's half the strength of a straight shot of tequila.

It also lets you stir it up as you drink.\nSilver (blanco) tequila is recommended as the other ingredients will provide plenty of flavors and it's an affordable choice for blended drinks.\nIf you don't have triple sec handy, you can substitute another orange liqueur, including Grand Marnier or orange cura?ao.\nRecipe Variations\nYou will find some recipes for a blended tequila sunrise margarita that suggest including the grenadine in the blender. That makes for a great-tasting drink, but you lose the visual sunrise effect.\nMezcal can be poured instead of tequila if you want a bit of smoke with your sunrise.\nTurn this into a frozen virgin sunrise for nondrinkers. Simply increase the orange juice to 3 ounces and skip the tequila and triple sec.\nYou can very easily transform this cocktail into a frozen ice pop. The recipe includes tequila, orange juice, and grenadine with Greek yogurt; the red and orange layers are separated to keep the drink's signature look.\nHow Strong Is a Tequila Sunrise Margarita?\nFrozen cocktails are almost always low-proof drinks because the ice adds a significant amount of volume to offset the alcohol. The tequila sunrise margarita is a perfect example, with an alcohol content of just 9 percent ABV (18 proof). That makes it slightly stronger than beer and a little lighter than wine but filled with a lot more flavor than either.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tequila-sunrise-margarita-recipe-760875

It\'s most often sold in 12-ounce cans and can be found near the juices at many stores.\nRecipe Variations\nTamarind paste or puree can be used as a substitute for the nectar, though you might want to add a little more simple syrup to sweeten it up. You can make your own tamarind paste or buy it at many grocers. There is a brick-like version of the paste that might be more difficult to deal with in a cocktail and is best reserved for food. Instead, look for jars of paste or ""concentrate.""\nCinnamon sugar is another great rimming option for tamarind drinks. Simply mix 3 parts sugar with 1 part ground cinnamon until it\'s a uniform color.\nBuild on the flavor of this cocktail by blending up a tamarind-pineapple margarita.\nHow Strong Is a Tamarind Margarita?\nDue to the ice, most frozen cocktails are low-proof drinks. The tamarind margarita falls right in line with all the rest; its alcohol content is just 10 percent ABV (20 proof) when blended. If you were to shake it, that jumps up to 18 percent ABV (36 proof), which is still pretty light for a nonblended margarita.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tamarind-margarita-recipe-760872

Garnish it with an orange wheel, pineapple cube, and cherry.\nOther black-eyed Susan recipes use vodka alone or skip the peach schnapps, while some vary the juice ratios.\nThis fruity cocktail is excellent with just tequila or rum; pour a full 2-ounce shot and keep the peach schnapps.\nMake this cocktail a little more refreshing by topping it with your favorite clear, lightly flavored soda.\nHow Strong Is a Black-Eyed Susan?\nWith a high volume of nonalcoholic mixers, the black-eyed Susan is not a terribly strong drink. All those fruits tame the alcohol content down to a pleasant 15 percent ABV (30 proof). That\'s in line with most tall mixed drinks and a little stronger than wine.\nWhen Was the Black-Eyed Susan Created?\nThe official story is that the black-eyed Susan made its debut at Pimlico Race Course during the 1973 race. It was created by Harry Stevens, whose catering company had long provided food at the Baltimore track. Stevens and his team wanted to create a special cocktail that took on the color of the black-eyed Susan flowers draped over each winning horse. The cocktail also pairs very well with the Maryland crab cakes that are traditionally served at Pimlico.\nWhy Are There So Many Black-Eyed Susan Recipes?\nThe drinks of the Belmont Stakes and Preakness Stakes have seen several iterations over the years. The Preakness has been more consistent, offering slight variations of the black-eyed Susan since it was introduced. These recipe changes are primarily due to which liquor company is the official sponsor for that year\'s race, so the ingredients feature those brands. Simultaneously, the mint julep is so ingrained in the Kentucky Derby that it has become a permanent fixture. The original will always remain the favorite; however, a new ""official"" mint julep recipe is released each year with a few minor tweaks.\nDelicious Kentucky Derby Food Ideas']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-eyed-susan-cocktail-recipe-761413

Add ice.\nShake vigorously.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass and top with a splash of soda water.\nMore Tips for Making a Great Whiskey Daisy\nTop-shelf and fresh ingredients are going to make a better whiskey daisy, and it is important to keep this in mind with every decision you make on the ingredients. Though don't let that scare you from trying this iconic drink, it's not hard to make good choices here.\nThe whiskey is probably the most complicated and we have already discussed that rye whiskey or bourbon will be great choices. Within those styles, opt for a premium brand because this is the base of the drink and will guide the entire flavor profile.\nFor the orange liqueur, one with a brandy base, such as Grand Marnier, adds depth to the drink and makes it more interesting than a daisy made with triple sec or cura?ao.\nFresh lemon juice and homemade simple syrup should be requirements. The bottled (easy-squeeze) lemon juices are simply too tart and will throw off the drink's balance.\nHomemade syrup is recommended for another reason: it's cheaper. Plain and simple, once you learn how easy and inexpensive it is to make your own simple syrup, you will never purchase a bottle at the liquor store again.\nIn this recipe, it is not as important to be picky about the soda. A splash is all that is needed and is there to add a little sparkle so feel free to use any soda. Just make sure it's fresh and still has great carbonation otherwise you are just adding more water to the daisy and that is pointless.\nMore About the Daisy Family of Cocktails\nAs mentioned above, the daisy is a style of cocktail and even though the base distilled spirit is swapped from one recipe to another, it does have common characteristics.\nAlmost every daisy will require an orange liqueur, a citrus juice (either lemon or lime), simple syrup, and a splash of club soda.\nYou can use this universal formula to interpret almost any daisy recipe, so when someone asks for a gin daisy or a brandy daisy you have a general idea of how to make it. That said, the popular brandy daisy does include rum as well, but you get the idea.\nHow Strong Is the Whiskey Daisy?\nMany dark orange liqueurs are 80 proof and that is standard for whiskey as well. When you pour those two spirits, the Whiskey Daisy is about average for finished cocktails and weighs in at right around 22 percent ABV (44 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiskey-daisy-cocktail-recipe-761399

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nRecently, DeGroff updated the Belmont breeze recipe and it is just as tasty as the original. The Belmont breeze no. 2 features rye whiskey, Pedro Ximenez Sherry, and DeGroff\'s own pimento bitters. It also skips the cranberry and syrup and opts for more orange juice.\nAs in the new recipe, feel free to top this one with club soda or lemon-lime soda (DeGroff recommends 7-Up) when serving it as a highball.\nSimilar to the mint julep, you can certainly muddle the mint and simple syrup and build this drink directly in the glass. Crushed ice is a good option as well.\nTips\nBourbon or rye whiskey, which should you choose? Really, either is a great option. This is especially true now that rye has made a comeback and many impressive brands are available again. Go with whatever you have in the bar or use this cocktail as an excuse to try something new.\nSherry is a Spanish style of fortified wine and it\'s a fantastic addition to this drink. It\'s interesting to note that in the new recipe, DeGroff switches from a medium-dry sherry to Pedro Ximenez, which is one of the sweetest. Either would make a good choice in this recipe. Amontillado and Oloroso are the richer varieties and well-suited for this Belmont breeze recipe. Fino will be the driest sherry you\'ll find.\nPay attention while pouring each of the three fruit juices, particularly the orange and cranberry. This is not meant to be one of those tall, super-fruity cocktails like the madras or sea breeze. Instead, they\'re mere accents that should not cover up the whiskey and sherry.\nThe same can be said about the amount of mint for the Belmont breeze. Where many mint cocktails (e.g., mojito and mint julep) typically use a ""sprig"" of mint, DeGroff is very specific. By using just five mint leaves, the drink retains a nice balance. Remember, it\'s not necessarily a ""mint cocktail,"" it\'s a ""cocktail with mint.""\nHow Strong Is the Belmont Breeze?\nPerfect for a day at the race track, the Belmont breeze is a rather gentle cocktail. When made with an 80-proof whiskey, it has an alcohol content around 16 percent ABV (32 proof).

It adds an extra depth of flavor and the warm spice completes the drink's experience. The nice part about the cinnamon stick is that it doubles as a stir stick!\nWhen cutting apple garnishes, be sure to dunk them in lemon juice immediately after slicing. This will stop the natural reaction that turns the fruit's flesh yellow once it's exposed to oxygen.\nFor the best tasting autumn delight, look for unfiltered apple cider. It's typically around during the autumn apple harvest, either in the grocer's produce section or direct from the orchard.\nIf you love a project in the kitchen and an apple tree in the backyard, make your own apple cider. It's easiest when done in a slow cooker and can be seasoned with spices like cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you are in the mood for a hot drink, heat up the cider before adding the whisky. Skip the ice, of course, and simply stir the drink as if it is a hot toddy.\nGive the drink a boost by adding 1 ounce of cinnamon schnapps. Make sure it's a high-end brand that matches the whisky's quality.\nHow Strong Is an Autumn Delight?\nYamazaki 12 is bottled at 86 proof, so it's a full-flavored whisky that will stand up to apple cider. Even though it's a little stronger than the average whiskey, when mixed into this recipe, the resulting drink is surprisingly light.

The juice of half a lemon should be perfect for one drink. Save time by squeezing it directly into the shaker.\nCut the lemon twist before juicing the fruit to maximize its usage. Typically, you can get two long twists out of one lemon. Store any extra peels in ice-cold water to maintain the curl.\nRecipe Variations\nThis drink can also be served up in a cocktail glass. Whenever you pass on the ice, though, be sure your glass is chilled to maintain a cold drink from start to finish.\nSkip the soda if you prefer or switch to a drier option than ginger ale like club soda or tonic water.\nUse this recipe for other styles of whiskey as well. Bourbon, rye whiskey, other blended whiskeys, even scotch can all work out nicely in this mix.\nHow Strong Is a Zesty Irishman?\nThe zesty Irishman is not what you would consider a light drink. That's partially due to the fact that Drambuie is just as strong as the average Irish whiskey (80 proof). With that base, the drink's alcohol content is 23 percent ABV (46 proof).

The only exception is that once the wash is complete, you will freeze the whiskey to solidify the fat so it can be strained off.\nThe time for your infusion is going to depend on your love for bacon-laced liquor. If you\'re not a huge bacon fan, four to six hours will give a gentle flavor. Westplate says that he likes a ""robust bacon profile,"" so he washes for 12 to 16 hours using a 100-proof rye whiskey.\nYou may need to adjust the infusion time, depending on the whiskey. Some have a very bold flavor profile, and whiskeys with a lighter taste may be better with less bacon flavoring.\nTo clarify bacon fat: Combine the rendered fat left after cooking bacon with twice the volume of water (e.g., 1/2 cup of fat to 1 cup water). Bring to a boil, reduce heat, then simmer for 2 minutes. Pour the fatty water into a bowl and refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours (or freeze for 2 hours) until the fat creates a solid layer on the top, which is your ""clarified"" bacon fat.\nIn a jar with a tight-sealing lid, add 1 tablespoon of clarified bacon fat to the rye whiskey.\nAgitate to thoroughly combine and shake it on a regular basis for the desired wash time: 4 to 16 hours, depending on your taste.\nAt the end of your wash time, freeze the whiskey until the fat has solidified. Don\'t worry, the whiskey itself will not freeze.\nRepeatedly strain the mix until the whiskey is clear and devoid of solid fat. Use cheesecloth in a fine-mesh strainer to make the task a little easier.\nMake Peanut Butter-Infused Amaretto\nThe peanut butter-infused amaretto is much easier and will take just under an hour to prepare. Use the same method for straining as you do when making the bacon whiskey.\nIf this shooter is not to your taste, you might want to try the infusion anyway. It\'s a delicious way to dress up the average bottle of amaretto.\nIn a jar with a tight-sealing lid, combine the creamy peanut butter and amaretto.\nAgitate to thoroughly combine. Let stand for 30 minutes.\nStrain until smooth. The resulting liquor will have the texture of a cream liquor.\nMake the PB and Bacon Shooter\nGather the ingredients.\nAdd the maple syrup to the bottom of a shot glass. \nIn a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake the bacon-washed whiskey and peanut butter-infused amaretto for about 10 seconds.\nStrain slowly over the back of a bar spoon to create a layer on top of the syrup.\nAdd a pinch of applewood-smoked salt to the top of each shot.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nBecause this drink includes a peanut infusion, be sure to ask anyone you\'re serving it to if they have a nut allergy. It can be easy to forget this when mixing up shots, but it\'s very important.\nOnce you have finished straining the two infusions, bottle them separately under a tight seal until you\'re ready to make the shots. Using an empty liquor bottle that has been cleaned out with the label removed is a great choice and a good way to recycle. Be sure to relabel it so you know what\'s inside and when you made it.\nIt\'s easy to make multiple shots at one time with this recipe. For instance, if you want to make a round of four shots, pour 4 ounces of whiskey with 2 ounces of almond-flavored liquor into the shaker at one time.\nHow Strong Is a PB and Bacon Shooter?\nThe infusions shouldn\'t affect the strength of the two liquors much, so let\'s assume they remain at the full bottling proof to estimate this shot\'s potency. Backed by a 100-proof whiskey, it comes out to a substantial 29 percent ABV (58 proof), making this one of the strongest shots you can mix up.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jason-westplates-big-fat-elvis-shooter-761363

There are some fascinating brands of this unaged corn whiskey available now, and you'll want to try a few to find one that suits your taste. Virginia Lightning from Belmont Farm Distillery, Midnight Moonshine, and Manhattan Moonshine are great choices.\nThe blueberry preserves are another unique element that's not often seen in cocktails, and you have to admire their effect. The cocktail requires a bit more shaking to ensure that the preserves are properly mixed, though the texture that results from using them is spectacular.\nIf you have blueberries in your garden, you might think about using homemade blueberry jam as well.\nHow Strong Is a French Quarter Smash?\nThe alcohol content of this drink is going to depend on the strength of the moonshine and brandy you pour. If you choose 80-proof spirits for both, you're looking at a drink in the 17 percent ABV (34 proof) range.

It can be stored like regular whiskey.\nTips\nMake as much pineapple whiskey as you like. The recipe makes just enough for the punch but it can easily be increased (pineapple whiskey makes an interesting highball). When doing so, increase both ingredients (exact proportions are not necessary). For instance, you could use 1 cup of pineapple to infuse an entire 750ml (just over 3 cups) bottle of whiskey. Also, no matter the quantity, you may need to extend the infusion time to at least three days. One day is very short for a mild flavor like pineapple, especially against a bold spirit like whiskey. Give yourself plenty of time before the party and test regularly until it reaches your desired intensity.\nMake the Coriander-Pineapple Syrup\nThis will make just over 1 cup of syrup, leaving you a little extra after mixing the punch. It will keep in the refrigerator for about 1 week.\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a small saucepan, bring the water and pineapple juice to a low boil.\nAdd the sugar, stirring constantly until dissolved.\nReduce the heat, add the coriander seeds, cover and simmer for 15 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat, keep covered, and let the syrup cool and steep. Strain out the coriander and bottle.\nMake the Punch\nGather the ingredients.\nCaramelize lemons by slicing a few lemons, heating a little oil in a pan and cooking the lemons for about 5 minutes, until soft and brown.

Garnish with several caramelized lemon slices\nPour into ice-filled serving glasses, adding another caramelized lemon slice to each. Serve and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is a Centennial Punch?\nEven when using a bold 94 proof whiskey, this punch is surprisingly light.

The absence of ginger is the primary difference and a honey syrup is used instead. It is very similar to the gin-based Bee's Knees with just a slight variation between the sweet and sour elements. You could also consider it a different approach to the Whiskey Sour.\nIt is a delightful cocktail and one that may work better with some bourbons more than others.\nTo make the drink, shake 2 ounces bourbon with 3/4 ounce fresh lemon juice and 1 ounce honey syrup. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nChoosing the Bourbon\nEach bottle of bourbon has its own unique characteristics and that is why this style of whiskey is so beloved. Yet, they're generally grouped into two flavor profiles: bold and soft. This gives you some interesting options when choosing a good whiskey for either Gold Rush.\nMuch of this is going to depend on taste, so play around with bourbons to see which you enjoy most.\nBold bourbons are often higher than 80-proof and are full of big, bold flavor.\nSoft bourbons have a milder flavor profile though they may be bottled above 80-proof and in no way are they a 'delicate' whiskey.\nWhich to choose? It's actually quite fun to pair either style of bourbon with either Gold Rush cocktail. If you're in the mood for a full-flavored drink, try a bold bourbon with the ginger recipe. If something smooth and relaxing is in order, try a soft bourbon with the honey syrup. Then again, you can mix and match the two flavor profiles.\nThere are many possibilities here and each new drink you mix up can be an entirely new experience.\nHow Strong Are the Gold Rush Cocktails?\nEither way you make it, the Gold Rush is about as strong as other whiskey cocktails of this style. It is a little lighter than those like the Manhattan because there are some alcohol-free mixers included in both recipes.\n\nYet, the Gold Rush is not the lightest drink you can mix up and they are full of flavor. With an 80-proof whiskey, we can estimate that these cocktails have an alcohol content of:\nThe Ginger Gold Rush: 23 percent ABV (46 proof)\nThe Honey Gold Rush: 18 percent ABV (36 proof)""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/gold-rush-cocktail-recipe-761356

If you forget to freeze one beforehand, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you\'re mixing up the drink. Dump them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nThe other popular whiskey derby cocktail has more of a whiskey sour style. It comes from Trader Vic\'s 1947 ""Bartender\'s Guide"", though even he could not agree on a single recipe because the book includes three different derby cocktails. This version combines 1 ounce of bourbon with 1/2 ounce each of sweet vermouth and orange cura?ao, and 3/4 ounce lime juice. It\'s shaken and strained into a cocktail glass, then garnished with a lime wedge and/or mint.\nA gin-based derby cocktail is listed in ""The Unforgettables"" category on the International Bartenders Association (IBA) website, though its origins are not entirely clear. To make it, stir 2 ounces of gin with 2 dashes of peach bitters and 2 sprigs of mint (no muddling, which is unusual for the herb) in a mixing glass with ice. Strain into a cocktail glass. A sprig of mint is used as the garnish.\nHow Strong Is a Derby Cocktail?\nThe Benedictine and gin derby cocktails weigh in at a hefty 32 percent ABV (64 proof), placing them among the strongest cocktails you can mix up. That\'s with an 80-proof whiskey or gin, too. If you\'re inclined to choose a stronger spirit the drinks could easily top 80 proof.

The additional flavors of pecan and honey will work very well against the ginger.\nHow Strong Is a Georgia on My Mind?\nThis cocktail is similar in strength to the whiskey Manhattan, though it is a touch lighter.

The cocktail's color will change ever so slightly, but the difference in taste will be nearly indistinguishable.\nTo make chocolate shavings, you can simply use a chocolate candy bar and a vegetable peeler. Make sure the chocolate is at room temperature, then run your peeler along one of the edges to get thin curls of chocolate.\nRecipe Variations\nThis is an enjoyable cocktail with almost any bourbon. The key is to find one that's full-flavored but not overly bold.\nThere are options for chocolate liqueurs as well, though they're all going to be slightly different than cr?me de cacao. Primarily, you'll find bottles that tend to be creamier, and your liquid bourbon ball will reflect that difference.\nAs an alternative to hazelnut, use amaretto instead. You'll be switching from a hint of hazelnut to one of almond and it creates an equally delicious cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Liquid Bourbon Ball?\nThe liquid bourbon ball is a delicious cocktail, but its alluring taste is also quite deceptive. It's a pretty strong drink, which should be obvious given the fact that it's made entirely of liquor. You can expect this one to have an alcohol content around 27 percent ABV (54 proof).

If your opened bottled has not been stored in the refrigerator or it\'s been open longer than a few months, it\'s time to replace it.\nWhenever you serve a cocktail ""up,"" it\'s best to chill the glass.

Good accents would be aromatic bitters, chocolate bitters, or one that\'s barrel-aged.\nIf you skip the vermouth and maraschino liqueur, you\'ll have a derby cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Creole Cocktail?\nYou likely noticed that the Creole cocktail is made entirely of liquor, which does make it a very strong drink.

While Smith Teamaker does make quality teas, feel free to use your favorite tea blend that concentrates on mint. Extraordinary new tastes can be found very easily by choosing a tea with extra layers of flavor already in the bag.\nEucalyptus leaves are not a common sight at most retailers. It can typically be found at natural food stores or where a good selection of dried herbs are sold. The menthol flavor that a eucalyptus leaf adds to this cocktail is invaluable and it is an element that should not be skipped.\nIf you have to buy eucalyptus in bulk (which is very likely) then you can always make a eucalyptus simple syrup for use in drinks like this Eucalyptus Martini and as a substitute for mint syrup in other drinks.\nHow Strong Is the Kentucky Tea?\nThis Kentucky Tea recipe is a very mild drink which is why it is perfect for a casual summer afternoon.

Try it with apple, citrus, coconut, pineapple, strawberry, or vanilla rums as well.\nGive your iced tea a little sparkle by finishing it off with a clear soda (e.g., club soda, ginger ale, etc.). Sparkling wine would also be a fun option, especially when served short and ""up"" in a cocktail glass.\nHow Strong Is a Mango Iced Tea?\nPerfectly casual, the mango iced tea is only as strong as the average glass of wine. When mixed with the suggested spirits, its alcohol content will be around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mango-rum-iced-tea-with-whiskey-761376

This makes it easier to ladle the drink without getting nutmeg and allspice in every glass. Unless the cinnamon stick is small, it should not have to be contained.\nThe root beer is used in this recipe as an accent flavor in the same manner that the spices are used. While 1/2 ounce will not make a big impact in a 40-ounce punch, the flavor is noticeable.\nKeep this punch warm all day long by skipping the saucepan and use your slow cooker instead. Give the mix a blast of heat by setting the cooker on high for an hour or two, then turn the temperature to low and let it rest until it's gone. Not only is this an easy way to serve hot drinks throughout the day, but it makes the house smell wonderful.\nRecipe Variation\nThis recipe makes about five 8-ounce servings and can easily be increased or decreased to fit the occasion. Be sure to keep the juice to whiskey ratio at 4:1.\nUsing root beer for a warm drink is a fantastic idea that can be taken into other recipes. Beyond cherry, it pairs very well with pomegranate and apple cider.\nHow Strong Is a Mulled Spice Cherry Punch?\nThis is a very mild punch because the cherry juice is four times the volume of the whiskey.

Not only does that leave the liquors undiluted, but they're also not chilled and that can be a little too harsh. This?and any whiskey shot, for that matter?will go down smoother when served a little colder, which is why it's best in a chilled shot glass.\nSouthern Comfort is a whiskey-based liqueur created in New Orleans, though for years it was?unknowingly to consumers?made with neutral grain spirits. That has changed and it's now made with North American whiskey from Sazerac, which is a big improvement. It has a flavor profile that cannot be matched by anything else on the market. The brand's secret recipe of fruits and spices mean that there is no really good substitute available.\nRecipe Variations\nA popular way to drink a shot of Southern Comfort is with a dash of lime. That's a great approach to add an extra kick of flavor to the Southern Joe as well.\nOf course, you can use any Tennessee whiskey in this recipe, though your options are limited. Go ahead and explore your options and have fun with how they change this shot.\nNo Tennessee whiskey in the bar tonight? Pour a bourbon instead. The flavor will be slightly different, but the basic profile will be the same, especially if you choose a robust, full-flavored whiskey.\nHow Strong Is a Southern Joe Shot?\nAn undiluted whiskey shot is going to get noticed because it's as strong as the liquors that go into it. An 80-proof whiskey and the 70-proof Original Southern Comfort together make a shot with an alcohol content of 37.5 percent ABV (75 proof), which is right between the bottling strengths of both.

Pour a spicy rye whiskey if you like or enjoy the smooth taste of a blended whiskey, such as those from Canada.\nMany of the cherry brandies available today are sweetened, making them more of a liqueur than a true brandy. It works very well, though you will notice a difference if you pour a brandy that\'s an eau-de-vie (distilled directly from the fruit\'s juice).\nFor the maraschino cherry, any cocktail is improved by using real maraschinos (e.g., Luxardo) or cocktail cherries. The neon red maraschinos are actually bleached then dyed and artificially flavored, leaving them anything but natural.\nYou can also make your own maraschino cherries by soaking fresh cherries in maraschino liqueur. Brandied cherries are another great homemade option.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, shake this cocktail with ice in a cocktail shaker, then strain it. Skip the ice if you like because it will be perfectly chilled.\nPour equal parts of whiskey and cherry brandy if you like.\nSwitch to a flavored whiskey (these will also typically be liqueurs) to give the drink more flavor.

You can generally squeeze half a lime directly into the shaker; a little extra doesn't hurt the flavor balance.\nPair those with fresh pineapple juice for the best rum punch. Either use a juicer or muddle a few chunks of fresh pineapple in a mixing glass and strain out the juice.\nThe bright red maraschino cherries that are so familiar are unnaturally dyed and flavored. Rather than use those as a garnish, pick up a jar of real maraschino cherries (they're often much darker) or make your own maraschinos.\nRecipe Variations\nSome Jamaican rum punch recipes use equal parts of dark rum and white rum. While overproof white rum is preferred, combining an 80-proof light rum with dark rum makes up for the stronger rum's flavor.\nGrenadine is a common syrup used in cocktails, though this punch is also often made with strawberry syrup. Either syrup can be held and drizzled over the strained cocktail for a layered effect.\nWhile many recipes pour equal amounts of rum, orange juice, and pineapple juice, you can switch that up. Some people prefer to knock the overproof rum down to 1 ounce or hold back a bit on the orange juice.\nHow Strong Is a Jamaican Rum Punch?\nEven when made with Wray and Nephew, the Jamaican rum punch is not as stiff as you may expect.

Personal budgets are a factor as well. For some people, a $30 bottle of tequila is a luxury, whereas others might consider tequilas over $50 to be top-shelf. The simplest recommendation is to pour the premium tequila that is a luxury to you. After all, you\'re the one drinking the Cadillac margarita, so you should enjoy it and be comfortable with the amount of money you spend.\nHow Strong Is the Cadillac Margarita?\nIn general, the margarita is not a light cocktail because it\'s made primarily with liquor. Additionally, Grand Marnier is 80 proof, which is the same as the average tequila. With those factors in mind, the Cadillac margarita\'s alcohol content falls around 27 percent ABV (54 proof), or about half the strength of a straight tequila shot.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between Grand Marnier and Cointreau?\nGrand Marnier and Cointreau are often considered the best brands of orange liqueur. While they\'re both flavored with the same citrus fruit, 80 proof, and enjoyable on their own, there is a noticeable difference in taste. Grand Marnier has a cognac base and is flavored with bitter orange essence; it\'s rather sweet but in no way cloying. Cointreau uses a sugar beet alcohol base, is flavored with sweet and bitter orange peels, and is slightly drier and crisper.\nWhat\'s the Best Salt for Rimming a Margarita?\nAvoid fine-grained salts, particularly iodized table salt, when rimming your margarita glass. The crystals are simply too small, get clumpy when wet, and create a very salty cocktail. For a much better drinking experience, choose a coarse salt, such as kosher salt or sea salt flakes. While there are plenty available and the flavors are fun, you don\'t need a dedicated ""margarita"" salt; it\'s often just kosher or sea salt. You can even make your own flavored salts with citrus zest, herbs, and spices.\nBest Fruit Flavored Margarita Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cadillac-margarita-recipe-760804

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a shot glass.\nSqueeze the lemon twist over the shot then hang it on the rim as a garnish. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe recipe produces a 2 3/4-ounce drink, which is rather large for a shot (typically they're around 1 1/2 ounces). That means you will either need a large shot glass or a small rocks glass to hold the drink. On the other hand, you can also pour two shots and share!\nWhile you can simply pour the two ingredients into a shot glass, you might want to think twice about it. These liquors have such distinct tastes that they can combat each other too much and create a rather off-putting flavor. The dilution from shaking helps to marry the flavors, making it go down much smoother. In the least, stir the shot with ice and strain it.\nServing this drink in a frosty shot glass is another way to relax the flavor. Simply run your glasses under cold water and stick them in the freezer for at least half an hour.\nRecipe Variations\nHave fun with this shot and explore various combinations of gin and whisky. Both liquors offer such a wide range of flavors that you'll never get bored with the silver bullet!\nIf you're not in the mood to shoot the drink, enjoy it as a slow sipping cocktail instead. Serve it in an old-fashioned glass on the rocks or as an up drink in a cocktail glass.\nHow Strong Is a Silver Bullet?\nSince you're pouring two full-proof liquors and no nonalcoholic mixers into this shot, you can expect it to be very strong. The shaking dilutes it a bit from bottling proof, yet when both your gin and scotch are 80-proof, it will have an alcohol content around 32 percent ABV (64 proof).\nOf course, both spirits are available at a higher proof as well, so the silver bullet can become even stronger. Just be careful because this drink can sneak up on you and you may become drunker than you'd like rather fast.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/silver-bullet-shooter-760563

Shake very well to achieve the characteristic frothy texture on top.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with coffee beans. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with any vodka martini, the vodka you choose will determine the overall quality of the drink. However, the coffee and chocolate are decadent flavors, and there are some fantastic budget-friendly vodkas available that work well in this drink.\nThe espresso is the most important ingredient. If you have an espresso machine, pull a few shots and put them in the freezer for a quick chill. It's important to add cold espresso to the shaker or your ice will melt too quickly.\nCoffee is not recommended for making an espresso martini since it is lighter and flavor and less potent, making the drink watery.\nRecipe Variations\nNo espresso machine? Brew coffee in a stovetop espresso pot or use a ready-to-drink espresso or cold-brew coffee concentrate.\nMany espresso martini recipes use as much as one ounce of simple syrup instead of chocolate liqueur. Some coffee liqueurs can be too sweet for this substitution and really don't need any additional sweetener. Eliminate the chocolate liqueur or start with 1/4 ounce of syrup to maintain a balanced drink.\nKick your espresso martini up another notch and use an espresso-flavored vodka.\nSkip the cr?me de cacao and start with chocolate vodka, adding 1/4 ounce more to make up for the liqueur. Vanilla vodka works as well.\nLight and vanilla rums are good vodka substitutes in the espresso martini.\nGive the martini a latte-like feel with a 1/4 to 1/2 ounce of Irish cream, another cream liqueur, or half and half. Dairy milk substitutes?particularly vanilla almond milk?work well, too.\nHow Strong Is the Espresso Martini?\nBetween the caffeine and alcohol, the espresso martini is not a gentle cocktail. Average for martinis, the alcohol content falls in the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range.\nWhich Coffee Liqueur Is Best for an Espresso Martini?\nKahl?a is typically the go-to coffee liqueur for the espresso martini, but there are other options. Tia Maria is a well-known and popular alternative that's not as sweet. You can also try the coffee liqueurs from brands like Firelit, Leopold Bros., New Deal, or St. George Spirits. If you're feeling crafty, make your own coffee liqueur.\nHow Do You Make the Espresso Martini Frothy?\nThe frothy top is one of the best parts of an espresso martini. It gives it that coffee shop feel, just like a shot of espresso. To ensure it appears on your martini, use freshly brewed (but chilled) espresso, shake the cocktail very well, and strain it into the glass quickly.\nTriple Espresso Martini""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/espresso-martini-recipe-761050

Enjoy.\nThis recipe can easily be adapted to create as many servings as you like. Downsize it for a small party or a snowy day at home or increase it for a larger crowd; simply retain the ratio of the three liquids. And, you will not hurt it one bit if you do pour in a little extra rum or Goldschlager.\nSlow Cooker Method\nIf you prefer, this warm punch can be prepared and served in a slow cooker. It's a hassle-free way to set up the punch for party service, especially if your stovetop is tied up with food or you have to transport it.\nSimply combine the ingredients in your slow cooker, stir it, and set it on the low setting for 2 to 3 hours. Stir the punch occasionally. If needed, you can set the cooker on the warm setting for another hour or two. \nAdding the Spices\nOne of the highlights of this punch is the gold flakes of Goldschlager. Since you don't want to lose any of that, it's best not to strain out the spices once the punch reaches its peak flavor. While it doesn't hurt to leave them in for the duration, you can easily remove them by placing the allspice and cloves into a mesh tea ball beforehand. The cinnamon sticks are easy to fish out with a large spoon.\nChoosing the Rum\nEven though dark rum is recommended, nearly any rum you have in stock will do. This spiked hot cider recipe works well with Bacardi Gold, or any other flavor of rum you prefer. However, the flavor of the apple and cinnamon set against a dark or aged rum really does set it off nicely. Since entertaining a crowd typically means having a budget in mind, consider choosing a good but affordable rum like Appleton Estate Gold or Cruzan Aged Dark.\nYou may actually find it best to avoid spiced rum. The spices in the punch take care of the flavoring and adding more via rum is unnecessary. Quite honestly, it almost ruins the punch.\nHow Strong Is the Hot Gold Apple Cider?\nGoldschlager is 87 proof and when paired with an 80-proof rum, the hot gold apple cider can be a pretty potent punch. It weighs in with an alcohol content of around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). Watch out for guests who may get a little tipsy. It really is so delicious that it's hard to stop drinking it.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hot-gold-apple-cider-cocktail-recipe-760530

Bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts have been enjoying Lillet Blanc in their classic drinks, but with reduced quinine, something was missing. The higher quinine percentage in Cocchi Americano provided the wonderful bitter tone that drinkers were seeking. The basic flavor is the same as the Lillet, but it has more punch. In many cocktails, it can take the drink from great to fabulous.\nCocchi Americano was difficult to find, but its recent rise to stardom is making it as readily available as Lillet Blanc. You may, however, have to visit a specialty liquor store to find either. If you cannot find them, a quality dry vermouth makes a good substitute.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many classic corpse reviver recipes, though only numbers 1 and 2 have survived the test of time. Today, the corpse reviver no. 2 is the most popular. This may be due to the fact that modern drinkers tend to prefer gin over brandy, though many will also tell you that no. 2 just has a more interesting flavor profile. But if you're looking into mixing interesting and alternative brunch cocktails, give a try to other revivers:\nCorpse Reviver No. 1: Stir 1 1/2 ounces brandy, 3/4 ounce Calvados or other apple brandy, and 3/4 ounce sweet vermouth with ice. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nCorpse Reviver No. 3: Shake 1 ounce each of brandy, cura?ao, and maraschino liqueur with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Alternatively, shake 1 ounce each of brandy, Campari, and triple sec with 1/2 ounce of lemon juice and ice, straining into a cocktail glass.\nCorpse Reviver No. 4, aka Savoy Corpse Reviver: Shake 1 ounce each of brandy, Fernet Branca, and white cr?me de menthe with ice and strain into a cocktail glass.\nHow Strong Is the No. 2 Corpse Reviver?\nThe corpse revivers are certainly not weak drinks and they do stand up to their reputation, or un-revive, if too many are consumed.

Garnish with an orange slice. Serve and enjoy.\nHow Do You Make a Pitcher of Mimosas?\nMake a pitcher of mimosas by increasing the ingredients proportionately. Wait to add the sparkling wine until you\'re ready to serve to ensure it stays bubbly.\nFor the recipe\'s 1-to-2 ratio, use 1 1/2 cups of orange juice and one 750-milliliter bottle of sparkling wine. If you include 1/2 cup of triple sec, this will make six 6 1/2-ounce mimosas.\nWhen making sweet 1-to-1 mimosas, combine 3 cups of orange juice with a bottle of wine. Adding 1/2 cup of triple sec produces 10 6-ounce mimosas.\nTips\nThe tall, skinny shape of a Champagne flute retains and enhances the wine\'s bubbles, making a livelier mimosa. White wine glasses are a good alternative. Stirring will reduce bubbles, so resist the temptation to mix it.\nAvoid floating bits of fruit in your glass by using pulp-free orange juice. Strain the pulp from fresh-squeezed orange juice; one large orange should make two drinks. A high-quality (not from concentrate), pulp-free bottled orange juice works as well.\nIce is not required for mimosas because dilution can soften the flavor too much. Instead, start with cold ingredients and, for an extra chill, pop the glasses in the freezer for 10 minutes or so.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a sweeter mimosa, pour equal parts of orange juice and sparkling wine, choose a sweet sparkling wine, or do both.\nHold the orange liqueur and float it on top of the drink after adding the Champagne.\nPour half a shot of cognac along with the triple sec. You can also switch from triple sec to the cognac-based Grand Marnier for a Grand mimosa or apricot brandy for a Valencia cocktail no. 2.\nMake a virgin mimosa with sparkling grape juice or cider instead of wine.\nPour a splash of grenadine for sweetness and a ""sunrise"" effect.\nAdd the fresh taste of fruits or herbs. Garnish the drink with a sprig of lavender, rosemary, or sage, or muddle seasonal fruits and the orange juice in a mixing glass, then double strain into the flute.\nMany mimosa-inspired recipes start by switching up the juice. For instance, grapefruit juice creates a megmosa. Apple, cranberry, pineapple, pomegranate, and watermelon juices are fun alternatives as well.\nWho Invented the Mimosa?\nThe mimosa\'s history is unclear. One story points to Frank Meier at Paris\' Ritz Hotel in 1925, but, unlike other recipes, he didn\'t claim it in his 1934 book, ""The Artistry of Mixing Drinks."" Many think that the mimosa was inspired by the Buck\'s fizz (invented at London\'s Buck\'s Club around 1925). Both drinks were likely influenced by a longtime French wine country favorite called Champagne-orange. Despite rumors, it\'s doubtful that Alfred Hitchcock devised the mimosa in the 1940s. However, it\'s true that a 1961 report of the British royal family enjoying mimosas popularized it as a brunch cocktail.\nWhat Is the Original Mimosa Recipe?\nThe first mimosas were likely equal parts of orange juice and Champagne. In David Embury\'s 1948 book, ""The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks,"" he describes it as ""Just another freak Champagne mixture..."" Over the years, the ratio was adapted to more closely reflect the 1-to-2 ratio in this recipe and the Buck\'s fizz. The triple sec arrived later in the 20th century as bartenders wanted to give the drink depth.\nWhat Is the Best Champagne for a Mimosa?\nSince it\'s mixed with a heavily flavored fruit juice, the mimosa doesn\'t require pricey French Champagne. Feel free to be frugal when selecting a mimosa-worthy bottle of wine; Spanish cava, Italian prosecco, and other sparkling wines offer the same taste, often at a lower price ideal for cocktails. Style-wise, many mimosa drinkers enjoy a drier wine because it counteracts the sweet acidity of the orange juice. Look for ""brut"" (meaning ""dry"") or ""extra dry"" on the label. When you want a sweeter sparkling wine, seek out labels with ""demi-sec"" (meaning ""half-dry"") or try a Moscato Asti, and remember that spumante is bubblier than frizzante.\nHow Strong Is the Mimosa?\nThe mimosa is always going to be just a little lighter than the wine you pour. When made with triple sec at the recipe\'s ratio, its alcohol content falls around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). At its lightest?no liqueur and equal juice and wine?it\'s a mild 7 percent ABV (14 proof).\n10 Fantastic and Flavorful Champagne Cocktails']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/great-mimosa-recipe-759734

Use a bar spoon to help maneuver everything into place if needed.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch from lime to lemon if you like. During the summer, honeydew melon and pineapple are great additions that work well with cucumber, too.\nMint, basil, and thyme pair perfectly with cucumber. Add a sprig of the herb to the muddle or use it to make an infused simple syrup.\nRather than gin or vodka, try this collins with rum or tequila instead.

Serve and enjoy.\nHow to Find or Make Passion Fruit Juice\nPassion fruit juice is not one of the most popular juices on the market; passion fruit pur?e or syrup is more common. These can often be found at stores specializing in natural food and international foods, and the syrup may be in a liquor store\'s mixer section. Frozen passion fruit concentrate or passion fruit nectar are other viable substitutes. You can also make juice or pur?e from fresh passion fruit, and this makes an excellent hurricane. However, the fruit\'s season is short, and it can be expensive.\nTo juice passion fruit, cut the fruit in half and scoop the pulp, seeds, and juice into a blender. For 5 to 6 fruits, add about 1/3 cup sugar (adjust to taste as some passion fruit varieties are very tart) and 1 quart of cold water. Blend at low speeds until the juicy seeds break up, and you have a liquid pur?e. Strain the pulp and broken seeds using a fine-mesh strainer or sieve, pressing out as much juice as you can. Bottle and refrigerate the juice and discard the pulp.\n\nDepending on the kind of passion fruit product you\'re able to find, you might need to adjust the cocktail with a little more or less simple syrup.\nWho Invented the Hurricane Cocktail?\nThe hurricane cocktail\'s origin is traced back to the 1939 World\'s Fair in New York City. Though it\'s unknown what was in the drink (rum is suspected), it was reportedly served at the Hurricane Bar and named after the hurricane lamp-shaped glasses it was served in. This style continues to be known as a hurricane glass and is the most popular way to serve the drink.\n\nFast-forward a few years to New Orleans at Pat O\'Brien\'s, where the famous version of the drink was invented. After World War II, brandy, gin, and whiskey supplies were slim, but rum was readily available. With an overstock of rum, the owners of Pat O\'Brien\'s (Benson ""Pat"" O\'Brien and Charlie Cantrell) reportedly asked head bartender Louis Culligan to create a drink that featured rum. Culligan\'s original hurricane recipe was published in Cabaret (a now-defunct magazine) around 1956. It was incredibly simple: 4 ounces of gold rum with 2 ounces each of lemon juice and Fassionola syrup.\nWhat Is Fassionola Syrup?\nFassionola syrup is a tropical fruit syrup that was reportedly invented in the 1930s by Donn Beach, a founder of America\'s tiki bars. Like many of his recipes, it was never revealed. The red syrup has since been created?both commercially and in homemade recipes?and is a fruity blend of passion fruit, papaya, strawberry, mango, pineapple, and hibiscus. In modern renditions of the hurricane, Fassionola has been replaced by passion fruit juice, pur?e, or syrup. At Pat O\'Brien\'s today, the hurricane is made with a premixed syrup and juice blend, which the bar markets and sells for home use. Other bars in New Orleans and beyond stick to the freshly made hurricane, similar to this recipe.\nWhat Is the Best Rum for a Hurricane?\nSome hurricanes are made with white rum alone, and Pat O\'Brien\'s has primarily stuck with gold rum. However, the combination of light and dark rums brings balance to the cocktail\'s sweet-tart fruity array. It\'s fun to play with the two rums, and each new pairing gives the drink a unique character. Midrange to top-shelf rums are best, and bartenders commonly choose a well-aged Caribbean rum for the dark rum. Spiced rum is an interesting choice as well.\nHow Strong Is the Hurricane?\nRum varies in strength, and that will affect the alcohol content of the hurricane. When made with two 80-proof rums, it mixes up to about 18 percent ABV (36 proof). While it\'s neither the strongest nor the lightest drink, the sweet taste makes it go down as easily as fruit punch.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWhen shaken, pineapple juice creates a foam on top of the drink. Some people don't enjoy that?though it does settle after a few minutes?so you can also stir this martini.\nSour mix is easy to find alongside other nonalcoholic mixers at liquor stores. You can save money and have more control over the flavor and ingredients by making fresh sour at home. Incredibly easy, it simply requires sugar, water, and lemon and lime juices.\nRecipe Variations\nSubstituting another orange liqueur for blue cura?ao will lose the martini's color. The viable replacement that will work, however, is Hpnotiq. The pale blue liqueur is flavored with tropical fruits, so while it's not orange, it is a good pairing for this martini's flavor.\nThis is just one of many blue martinis to mix up. For instance, using blue cura?ao, you can go dry with the Sapphire martini's gin and dry vermouth, build on that by adding pear vodka for a Daphne martini, or take the sweeter route with peach schnapps in a Sapphire alpine.\nHow Strong Is a Deep Blue Sea Martini?\nThe strength of this martini may vary a bit depending on the blue cura?ao you choose. As an example, pouring a 60-proof liqueur and 80-proof vodka results in a deep blue sea martini right around 22 percent ABV (44 proof). It won't get much stronger than that and is average for fruity martinis.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/deep-blue-sea-martini-recipe-761040

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAny whiskey can make a nice Washington apple. Crown Royal is the original brand of choice, but other Canadian and blended whiskeys are excellent as well.\nWhile sour apple schnapps is often used in the Washington apple, it\'s an excellent drink without the sour bite. Try it with an apple liqueur from a brand like Berentzen or an authentic German apple schnapps such as those made by Sch?nauer and Siegburg.\nOnce cut and exposed to oxygen, the flesh of an apple will turn brown rather quickly. To slow down oxidation and keep your apple garnishes looking fresh, squeeze lemon juice over the slices.\nRecipe Variations\nOn the Rocks: Build the ingredients in an ice-filled old-fashioned or highball glass and stir well. Add an apple slice or more cranberry juice if desired.\nAs a Shot: Shake 1/2 ounce of each ingredient with ice and strain into a chilled shot glass. Crown Royal\'s official mix is a little different: 1 1/4 ounces whisky, 1/4 ounce apple schnapps, 1 1/2 ounces cranberry juice.\nSome drinkers prefer their Washington apple with a splash of soda. Choose a lemon-lime soda like 7-Up or go with club soda or ginger ale. It can be added to any style of drink; pour just a splash in martinis and shots and add a bit more to tall glasses.\nWhat\'s the Best Crown Royal Whisky for a Washington Apple?\nCrown Royal has a vast lineup of Canadian whisky to choose from and many are all great in the Washington apple. Deluxe is the standard bottle that\'s often simply referred to as Crown Royal, and the most commonly poured in this drink. Crown Royal Black is a good upgrade (particularly for the martini version) with a bolder flavor that will punch through the fruits. The Rye and Blenders\' Mash may be a little too spicy, while the other unflavored whiskeys cost a bit more and might be best enjoyed straight or in a Manhattan. Crown Royal Apple will accentuate the drink\'s apple flavor, but the brand\'s vanilla and peach flavored whiskeys will give it a little more sweet, fruity depth.\nWhat Is the Best Sour Apple Schnapps?\nTaste is always subjective and one person\'s idea of the ""best"" sour apple schnapps may be different from yours. The most popular brand is probably DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker, and some of its fame is likely attributed to the fact that it\'s incredibly easy to find. Sour apple schnapps do vary in taste and quality, so it\'s worth checking out other options. Brands like Bols, Leopold Bros., Mr. Boston, and Mr. Stacks deserve a taste, particularly in the Washington apple.\nHow Strong Is the Washington Apple?\nWhen mixed with ice using 80-proof whiskey and 30-proof schnapps, the Washington apple weighs in around 16 percent ABV (32 proof). That\'s relatively light compared to other martini-style drinks and shots. However, sweet drinks like this can be deceiving because the sugars make you thirstier, so it\'s easy to have one too many. You can combat that by drinking some water in between Washington apples.\nBartender\'s Guide to the Most Popular Bar Drinks']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/washington-apple-shot-or-martini-761516

Serve and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is the Kiwi Martini?\nThe double shot of vodka used in this kiwi martini means that this is not a weak drink. It may be sweet, fruity, and really cute, but it has an alcohol content around 34 percent ABV (68 proof). This is only slightly lower than the bottling proof of the average flavored vodka, which is typically 70 proof. Keep this in mind because drinks like this will sneak up on you.\nTips\nProbably the biggest challenge with the kiwi martini is skinning the fruit. It's a fuzzy little thing and the skin is not very easy to remove. But if you cut off the ends of a kiwi and work a spoon around the inside of the skin, all the green flesh pops right out.\nYou can also use granulated sugar rather than simple syrup. However, the syrup prevents any issues with dissolving sugar and is very easy to make at home, which is why it's often preferred for drinks.\nWhen you're making syrup, you can add kiwi juice and create a kiwi-flavored syrup. With that, you can skip the muddling process and use 1/2 ounce (or a little more) syrup. Alternatively, using kiwi syrup and muddling the fruit doubles up the kiwi flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile a clear or citrus vodka works really well, you may also want to try a kiwi vodka.\nIf you like, you can use an entire kiwi for a single drink to really ramp up the fruity flavor. This is a good idea if you want to cut back on the vodka (3 ounces is a double shot) and replace it with more kiwi juice and simple syrup. It's going to depend on your personal taste, so play with the three ingredients to find your ideal ratio.\nHave some extra fun in the kitchen by turning this cocktail into a frozen ice pop.

Find a smooth, budget-friendly vodka to pour and save the really good bottles for vodka martinis.\nThe bay breeze can be made short in an old-fashioned glass for a slightly stronger drink, or weaker with more juice in a larger glass.\nRecipe Variations\nSome bay breeze fans prefer to pour 2 parts cranberry juice and 1 part pineapple juice.\nMake up a pitcher and serve it for brunch. It's easy to increase if you measure it in parts: Keep the vodka at 1 part and the juices at 1 1/2 parts each.\nPlay with flavored vodkas. Fruit vodkas are a good choice, and this drink is often made with coconut rum or vodka. It's a good mix when experimenting with your homemade herbal infusions as well.\nAdd some sparkle by topping it with light soda or sparkling wine.\nAdd ice cubes with fruit frozen inside. Small berries, like raspberries, are perfect and you can even use herbs such as lavender or rosemary. Fill the ice cube trays halfway, let them freeze partially, add the fruit or herb, then fill and freeze.\nHow Strong Is a Bay Breeze?\nVodka highballs are low-proof drinks because of the high concentration of fruit juice. For the bay breeze, the alcohol content should be around 9 percent ABV (18 proof), which is right in between the strength of beer and wine.\nWhat's the Difference Between a Bay Breeze and a Sea Breeze?\nThe bay breeze is part of a family of fruity vodka drinks that are closely related. They're made in the same way, and getting a new drink is simply a matter of swapping out one of the juices. While the bay breeze uses pineapple, the sea breeze mixes grapefruit juice with the cranberry.

Stir well.\nFill the glass with ice (if desired) and top with beer. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf your beer and juices are cold, there's really no need to add ice unless you'd like to. Your drink will also stay colder if you pour it into a frosty glass.\nPour the beer slower than normal and stop with a little extra room at the top. The foam head will form quickly as it interacts with the pineapple juice. You can always top it off once the head relaxes.\nJalape?o simple syrup is very easy to make at home. You will need a raw sugar such as demerara, two peppers, and a cup of water. It takes just 20 minutes but will need to cool before you mix with it.\nFresh lemon juice is best. The average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces of juice, so one fruit is more than enough for a few shandies. You can even simply squeeze a lemon wedge directly into the drink.\nYou can use a juicer to make fresh pineapple juice or muddle chunks of the fruit, then strain out the juice. If you buy the juice, consider using smaller cans so any leftovers don't go bad before you get a chance to drink it.\nA silver (blanco) tequila is an excellent choice for this shandy. Yet, it is really interesting with the slight oakiness found in a reposado tequila.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a milder spice that will also complement the pineapple, try a peppercorn syrup. Use either pink or black peppercorns?about 1/4 cup?and make it according to the cardamom simple syrup recipe.\nIf you want to eliminate the spice entirely, a plain simple syrup will work just fine.\nPour vodka instead of tequila if you prefer.\nMake this shandy as a punch to make serving a group quick and easy: Increase all of the ingredients in proportion for the number of servings you need. When making it ahead of time, hold the beer until you're ready to serve. You can also mix up the base (tequila, juices, and syrup) only then add the beer in the individual glasses.\nHow Strong Is a Spicy Pineapple Shandy?\nOddly enough, the alcohol content of the spicy pineapple shandy is going to be nearly identical to the beer you pour. That's due to the fact that the strength of the tequila is counteracted by the juice and syrup. For example, if you're using a 5 percent ABV beer, your shandy will weigh in right around there, too.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spicy-pineapple-shandy-recipe-4588949

Anything you like to drink can work.\nIf you're selecting a bottle for the purpose of making a spritzer, reach for something that has a good fruity flavor, and mild tannins, such as a sauvignon blanc, riesling, and pinot noir.\nVariations\nIf you find yourself with a few bottles of wine but are looking for more interesting ways to serve and drink them, there are many refreshing recipes that combine wine with other ingredients to make party-worthy cocktails.\nSangria, of course, is a classic wine-based cocktail that can take on a variety of flavors. A strawberry-lime sangria is ideal for summer, with a blend of ros?, lemon-lime soda, fresh strawberries, and mint. And a citrus sangria brings together grapefruit, orange, lemon, and lime for a refreshing cocktail on a warm day.\nThere are also some lesser-known wine-based mixed drinks worth trying. The bishop cocktail is a mixture of red wine, rum, simple syrup, and lime juice, whereas the pink elephant combines raspberry puree, chocolate liqueur, and merlot.\nHow Strong Is The Easy Wine Spritzer?\nThis easy wine spritzer is a mild mixed drink. The only alcohol in it is wine, which tends to range from 8 to 14 percent alcohol by volume (ABV).\n\nFor example, when a 10 percent ABV is watered down with soda and ice, the finished drink will have an alcohol content around 3 percent ABV.

Half of a lemon and lime should be the perfect amount for one cocktail.\nCream is typically called for in this cocktail. Some people prefer half and half or milk; both will create a lighter drink.\nThe egg white adds to the fizz\'s silky, foamy quality and really sets the drink over the top. The key to safely drinking raw egg is to ensure your egg is fresh: Pour a glass of water, place the egg inside and if it sinks, it\'s good. Floating eggs should be discarded.\nRecipe Variation\nIn the book, ""Joy of Mixology,"" Gary ""Gaz"" Regan points out that blending this drink is a great option to the long shake.

Be sure to use a fine-mesh strainer to capture all the seeds and small pieces of fruit.\nIf you have a juicer, use that for the watermelon to maximize the juice yield. Store any excess in a tightly sealed bottle in the refrigerator and use it within a couple of days.\nYou can find vanilla syrup at most grocery stores because it's a popular flavor for sweetening coffee.\nVanilla syrup is also very easy to make at home. All you need is 2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of water, and a vanilla bean. Stir the sugar into boiling water, reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Pour the syrup over a split vanilla bean in a heatproof jar. Let it steep for about 8 hours before removing the bean and bottling the syrup. It's even easier (and cheaper) with 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract added to the hot syrup.\nWatermelon beer can be made in any tall glass, no matter the volume. The point is to fill the glass half-way with the juice and syrup mix then fill it the rest of the way with beer.\nYou can certainly add ice if you like. It's not necessary if you use a chilled glass and ice-cold beer, though.\nRecipe Variation\nMake a pitcher of watermelon beer for a cookout or pool party. Increase the ingredients to fill your pitcher or for the number of servings needed. If you want to make it ahead of time, combine the watermelon juice and syrup. Hold the beer until it's time to serve.\nUse plain simple syrup or agave nectar if you prefer. Basil or mint simple syrups would also be nice complements to the watermelon.\nAdd other melons to the muddle or try this beer recipe with honeydew or cantaloupe alone.\nGive the watermelon beer a nice kick by adding a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of rum or tequila.\nHow Strong Is a Watermelon Beer?\nWatermelon beer is a relaxing, low-proof drink. Basically, it will be half the strength of your beer. For example, pouring a wheat beer that has 5.5 percent ABV will result in a watermelon beer that's just 2.75 percent ABV. Add a shot of rum to that and its alcohol content will be slightly less than the beer (5 percent ABV).\nEasy Summer Shandy""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/watermelon-beer-4571044

Enjoy.\nDoes Homemade Apple Pie Moonshine Need to Be Refrigerated?\nAs a liqueur, apple pie moonshine doesn\'t need to be stored in the refrigerator. You can refrigerate it if you like; it will extend the shelf life and the chill makes it easier to drink straight. While the high alcohol content does preserve it, homemade liqueurs can go bad and develop an off-flavor. Since it doesn\'t have the shelf life of commercial liqueurs, it\'s best to drink the apple pie moonshine with a month or two.\nTips\nA 750-milliliter bottle of unflavored moonshine yields just over the 3 cups required of this recipe.\nWhen splitting the moonshine into smaller jars, place one cinnamon stick in each. It does not have to be removed and will continue to infuse the moonshine with flavor.\nThe apple cider cooks down as it heats and the recipe fills a quart jar all the way with a little extra for your tasting samples. If you want more space to work, blend the cider and moonshine in a bowl or larger jar, then transfer it to the final jar(s).\nThe ground spices will leave a bit of sediment in the finished moonshine. If you prefer to eliminate that, line the strainer with cheesecloth or filter it through cheesecloth after resting.\nRecipe Variations\nUse any or all of the spices to create a custom combination. Cinnamon is the key spice and it can even be used alone.\nReplace the nutmeg and cloves with 4 to 6 allspice berries or 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice.\nInstead of moonshine, use 2 cups 190-proof grain alcohol and 1 cup vodka. Combine the two, then blend it with the apple cider. For a balanced flavor, start with equal parts of the makeshift moonshine and cider. Add more of either ingredient to suit your taste; it will naturally have more of a bite due to the higher alcohol content.\nHow Strong Is Apple Pie Moonshine?\nSweetened apple pie moonshine is a homemade liqueur. When you dilute 100-proof moonshine with the apple cider, the strength is lowered to about 70 proof (35 percent ABV). That\'s the same as a flavored vodka but stronger than the average liqueur (40 proof). This is a nice range for a drinkable liquor that doesn\'t burn terribly when you take a straight shot. If you opt for the grain alcohol-vodka blend, the ""moonshine"" will fall somewhere in the 116 proof (58 percent ABV) range.\nCandy Appley Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/apple-pie-moonshine-5078728

The majority of modern ginger beer is a soft drink and a spicier version of ginger ale that's typically made with real ginger. Good ginger beers can be drunk straight and make an excellent cocktail mixer.\nCan You Make a Moscow Mule With Ginger Ale?\nMany people, including bartenders, have been making the Moscow mule with ginger ale or citrus soda for years. If you want to keep it authentic, then this cocktail requires ginger beer. Technically, if you pour ginger ale, you're making a vodka buck. It's a vodka press with lemon-lime and club sodas, and club soda alone makes it a vodka soda.\nWhat Is the Best Ginger Beer for a Moscow Mule?\nThere are many impressive ginger beers to choose from today. The options are increasing all the time, thanks in large part to this particular drink. Each brand varies in the ginger's intensity as well as the sweetness. Some have a softer spice reminiscent of ginger ale, while others are very strong and unforgettable.

Both make an excellent mule and fall right in the middle of the extremes.\nHow Strong Is the Moscow Mule?\nThe average Moscow mule is fairly tame, though it will vary with more or less ginger beer. If you pour an 80-proof vodka with 4 ounces of ginger beer, the alcohol content is just 11 percent ABV (22 proof). In general, it's equivalent to the average glass of wine.\nThe Moscow Mule's History\nAlong with drinks like the white Russian, the Moscow mule was designed to sell vodka to U.S. drinkers in the mid-20th century. Before that time, vodka was relatively unknown to Americans, though it didn't take long for them to fall in love with the clear spirit.\nThere are a couple of claims to the invention of the Moscow mule. One dates to 1939 at the Cock 'n Bull pub in Hollywood. The story goes that the bar's owner, Jack Morgan, partnered up with Smirnoff Vodka's John Martin to promote the vodka and the bar's house-made ginger beer. Apparently, it was a winning situation for the team because both beverage brands are alive and well today.\nAnother story jumps ahead to 1941 at the same bar when the head bartender, Wes Price, needed to unload some liquor that wasn't selling. This successful promotion was enhanced by a marketing campaign in which a Moscow mule made with Smirnoff was served in copper mugs. The mugs became the drink's trademark vessel, the campaign was a success for the Russian vodka, and the mule was a smash hit.\nIs It Safe to Drink From a Copper Mug?\nThe popularity of the Moscow mule's copper mug has brought up the possibility of copper toxicity. The concern is that acidic food and drinks can leach copper out of unlined copper vessels, and the U.S. FDA has guidelines for establishments that use this material.1\ufeff\ufeff Experts say that a drink would have to sit in the mug for hours to get a harmful amount of copper, and it is not advised to store acidic food or beverages in copper. However, most copper mugs sold today are lined with nickel, stainless steel, or another food-safe coating and are perfectly safe for drinks.\nThe 8 Best Moscow Mule Mugs of 2023\nRecipe Variations\nSince this is such a popular cocktail, it's no surprise that the Moscow mule has served as inspiration for many more drink recipes. It's the perfect base for experimentation, and you can really have fun playing with its flavors.\nIn the vodka ginger cocktail, the ginger beer is swapped out for a combination of ginger simple syrup and club soda. This results in a sweeter, less spicy drink.\nSwitch your vodka out for gin, and you have the classic foghorn.\nAdd dimension by muddling a little mint into the foghorn and enjoy the popular gin-gin mule.\nThe Kentucky mule, or horsefeather, uses a shot of bourbon for the liquor.\nA drink called the Mexican mule prefers tequila.\nWhile a Cuban or Jamaican mule features rum, the dark 'n stormy calls for a specific dark rum.\nWarm things up in winter with pear vodka and ginger beer to create a steaming Christmas mule.\nPerfect for autumn, adding apple cider to the basic mule formula creates a wonderful apple cinnamon mule.\nCocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/moscow-mule-recipe-759741

Don't pour too much rum, avoid spills and splashes, and let everyone around you knows there is about to be fire. It's also important to ensure the flame is completely extinguished before drinking?under bright lights it may be difficult to see the blue flame. If you've had a bit too much to drink already, skip the fire and save it for another day.\nRecipe Variations\nThe B-51, B-52, B-53, and B-54 have three things in common. They always have an equal pour of three liquors, two of which, Kahl?a and Baileys, are almost always used and in that order. They're always layered in the order the ingredients are given so the heaviest liquor is on the bottom and the lightest on the top. Here are some popular variations:\n\nB-51: Equal pours of Kahl?a, Baileys Irish Cream, and Frangelico.\nB-53: Typically includes an anise-flavored liqueur, such as sambuca or absinthe.\nB-54: Equal pours of Kahl?a, Baileys, and tequila.\nHow Strong Is a B-52 Shot?\nIf you pour any of these shots with the indicated, or call brands, and keep the third ingredient at 80 proof, it's easy to estimate their strength. There's no dilution, so the average layered B-52 is about 26 percent ABV (52 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nMake cinnamon sugar by mixing together 1 part ground cinnamon and 2 parts white sugar until it is a uniform light brown color.\nTo prevent the apple flesh from browning due to oxidation, dip the garnish in lemon juice.\nTake advantage of the autumn apple harvest by using fresh-pressed apple cider if you can find it. A trip to the local apple orchard is not only a great way to spend an afternoon, but also one of the best places to find fresh cider to take home as many orchards offer it as well. This cider tends to have a deeper apple flavor than the average cider sold at grocery stores and can really add a nice flair to the mimosa.\nIf you have a lot of whole apples, you can also make your own apple cider at home. It's surprisingly easy in your slow cooker and you get the extra bonus of filling your home with the comforting aroma of warm, spiced apples.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile this mimosa recipe is excellent with regular vodka, you can really add a nice background flavor to it with a flavored vodka, like the recommended pear vodka. Other flavors that would be fun in this recipe are cinnamon?a DIY infusion?and vanilla, which is available from many vodka brands.\nThis is also a great cocktail for a multidimensional vodka with lots of seasonal flavors. For instance, you can infuse the same ingredients in this spiced pear liqueur into your favorite vodka.

To get the most juice out of grapefruit, warm it up to room temperature. Then give it a little abuse by pressing it against the counter. Now cut it and squeeze it with a manual juicer or reamer. A typical grapefruit will produce 3/4 cup or 5 to 6 ounces of juice.\nYou can make homemade grenadine in several ways. Pomegranate juice is readily available, or you can even use fresh pomegranates. Homemade grenadine lacks the preservatives found in commercial products, so it will only keep for about three weeks.\nWhile you don't have to use your best vodka for the firefly. Aim for a smooth middle-ground vodka rather than the cheapest.\nRecipe Variations\nThough it doesn't call for a garnish, adding a slice of citrus fruit will dress up the drink. Grapefruit is the best choice, but a lemon or lime slice will work just as well.\nThis is an excellent drink to make by the pitcher. Simply mix up the vodka and grapefruit juice, increasing them in proportion to the number of servings you need. When you're ready to serve, pour it over ice in tall glasses and add the grenadine.\nYou may want to play with flavored vodkas in the firefly. While citrus vodka seems like an obvious choice, try one that will add a bit more contrast like strawberry, raspberry, or pineapple.\nGrapefruit and spice are perfect flavor companions, so you may even want to try this with a homemade hot pepper-infused vodka. Just take care to balance the pepper and remember that these infusions take hours, not days.\nHow Strong Is a Firefly?\nMost of this drink's volume is made up of nonalcoholic mixers, so it's a delightfully light drink. When mixed with an 80-proof vodka, it should weigh in somewhere around 10 percent ABV (20 proof), so it's a lot like drinking a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/firefly-cocktail-recipe-759660

The fortified wine does not have the long shelf life of distilled spirits and will go stale just three months after the bottle is opened.\nSwitch to a highball glass and add more soda for a tall thirst quencher.\nWhen Was the Americano Invented?\nA classic cocktail, the Americano was first served in the 1860s at Gaspare Campari\'s bar in Milan, Italy. It was originally named ""Milano-Torino"" because of the origins of its two primary ingredients: Campari calls Milan home and the sweet vermouth was made in the style of Torino, Italy. The cocktail was later renamed because of its popularity among American tourists around the turn of the 20th century and prior to Prohibition.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between the Americano and Negroni?\nCampari is best-known for two famous cocktails: the Americano and Negroni. Both drinks use equal parts Campari and sweet vermouth, but the Negroni does not include soda, opting for an equal measure of gin instead. The Americano actually spurred the creation of the Negroni in the 1920s. It\'s said that Count Camillo Negroni ordered ""an Americano with gin""1\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff while at a cafe in Florence, Italy. It\'s unclear if that story is true, however.\nJames Bond and the Americano\nIt seems that Ian Fleming also had a fascination with the Americano. This is the first cocktail ordered by James Bond in ""Casino Royale,"" Fleming\'s first 007 spy novel. However, the Vesper martini (or the manner in which it was ordered) overshadowed the Americano in the books and movies.\nThe Americano did make a few appearances in the series. In the short story, ""A View to a Kill,"" Fleming explains where Bond thinks it appropriate to enjoy an Americano. He writes that ""One cannot seriously drink in French cafes"" and that gin, whiskey, and vodka have no place on sunny sidewalks. In this venue, ""Bond always had the same thing?an Americano.""\nHow Strong Is the Americano?\nYou can, of course, top the Americano with as much soda water as you like, and this will affect the strength of the cocktail. As an estimate, if the total volume is around 5 ounces, this Campari cocktail weighs in at a gentle 9 percent ABV (18 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/americano-cocktail-recipe-759279

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYour choice in bourbon will lay the foundation for this drink's overall taste. A robust, high-proof whiskey is a great choice because it cuts through the vermouth. Bourbons distilled with a portion of wheat will create a softer cocktail, while a rye-rich bourbon will give it a spicier foundation.\nAlmost any brand of vermouth will make a great cocktail. Some drinkers prefer dry vermouth from one brand and sweet vermouth from another. The nice thing is that most vermouth is relatively inexpensive, so you can shop around to find your ideal combo.\nKeep in mind that vermouth has a much shorter shelf life than liquor. Refrigerate it after opening, mark it with the date, and use it within three months.\nRecipe Variations\nServe the perfect Manhattan on the rocks. The ice will dilute the drink slightly and mellow out the flavor and alcohol.\nLike the original Manhattan, this cocktail works very well with rye whiskey and Canadian whisky.\nSwitching to scotch creates a perfect Rob Roy.\nThough just an accent, play around with other flavors of bitters. Orange and barrel-aged are excellent alternatives, and some interesting Manhattans are made with cherry, plum, and walnut bitters.\nGarnish with an orange twist in place of the maraschino cherry.\nHow Strong Is the Perfect Manhattan?\nAll Manhattan cocktails are strong drinks because they're made entirely of alcohol. If you choose a high-proof whiskey, this drink's alcohol content will fall in the 39 percent ABV (78 proof) range. With an 80-proof whiskey, it's still a hefty 33 percent ABV (66 proof). It's a good one-off drink before switching to something lighter.\nShould a Manhattan Be Shaken or Stirred?\nThe general rule is that liquor-only cocktails should be stirred rather than shaken. This applies to all Manhattans and martinis. However, rules are meant to be broken to fit your personal taste. Shaking a perfect Manhattan adds dilution and air to the cocktail, and some drinkers prefer the softer taste.\nWhat Is the Best Cherry for a Manhattan?\nRather than the neon-red maraschino cherries that are so familiar, look for natural maraschino cherries that are not dyed and artificially sweetened. Luxardo and other companies offer jarred maraschinos that are just as convenient or you can make your own maraschinos.\n\nHow to Batch Any Cocktail for a Party""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/knob-creek-bourbon-manhattan-cocktail-761372

This recipe provisions for those who want to shake versus those who want to stir their cocktails. Why the distinction? Generally speaking, shake cocktails whose ingredients need integration: think citrus juices or a sour mix, for example. The general rule of thumb is that spirit-only cocktails should be stirred, but many like their vodka martini shaken. It is a case of personal preference for dilution and/or taste.\nWhat Is a Dry Vodka Martini?\nOver the years, the vodka martini began to lose its dry vermouth. Often, it didn\'t even make it into the glass?despite the contradiction, it\'s called a ""dry vodka martini.""\nThe recipe\'s ratio is in the 3:1 vodka-vermouth range, which gives the drink some depth. Of course, you can adjust this to your taste; many bartenders mix it at 5:1 (2 1/2 ounces vodka and 1/2 ounce vermouth). Keep at least a hint of vermouth, which makes it ""extra dry;"" otherwise, it\'s simply vodka straight up. If the taste is not your favorite, try rinsing the glass with it, then dump out the excess, which essentially seasons the glass with the fortified wine. You may find it very enjoyable.\nTips\nThe vodka you choose will either make or break this cocktail because vodka is the star; there\'s nothing to disguise a bad one. Pour the best vodka you have in the bar and use this recipe to test out new premium brands.\nMake sure your vermouth is fresh. The fortified wine has a limited shelf life of just three months once the bottle is open. Write the open date on the bottle and replace it regularly to ensure the best vodka martini.\nOrange or aromatic bitters are optional but a nice addition. There are many fascinating new bitters on the market?try lavender, lemon, or peach. Even celery can make an interesting martini.\nThe typical garnish is either a lemon twist or a few olives. Both add flavor to the otherwise transparent cocktail, so it\'s often best to include one or the other.\nThere is an old bar superstition that using an even number of olives is bad luck. Plus, one large or three small olives is more visually pleasing than two.\nHow Strong Is the Vodka Martini?\nThe vodka martini follows suit with the gin martini, Manhattan, and other liquor-vermouth cocktails: They\'re not light drinks. With an 80-proof vodka and the average vermouth in this recipe\'s ratio, it mixes up to about 28 percent ABV (56 proof). To put that into perspective, two martinis are stronger than a straight shot of vodka.

The apricot brandy is self-explanatory, though I encourage you to seek out a 'real' apricot brandy. That is one that does not include sugars and sweeteners, which technically makes it more of a liqueur rather than a true brandy.\nIn recent decades, it has become common for liquor brands to offer sweetened fruit 'brandies' and quite often they're made with artificial sweeteners. Many drinkers have avoided these for years because they're honestly just not that good.\nThere is good news, though! As the new cocktail renaissance continues, more and more distillers are returning to the old ways of making fruit brandy -- distilling from actual apricots (or other fruits). It is becoming easier to find great options, you just have to look for them. You may find an apricot brandy from craft distilleries or labels like Blume Marillen Apricot Eau-De-Vie (Austrian from Haus Alpenz).\nThis is perfect for classic cocktail lovers because many great recipes like the Baltimore Bang rely on it.\nIf you really cannot find true apricot brandy, do what many of us have done for years and turn to high-end apricot liqueurs. Three of the best are Marie Brizard Apry, Giffard Abricot du Roussillon, and Rothman & Winter Orchard Apricot.\nThe Sour Mix. Sour drinks rely on some combination of sweet and sour. In the recipe above, a 'sour mix' is used and this is, quite simply a citrus-flavored simple syrup. It's very easy to make a sour mix at home and it's actually recommended because those you can buy at the store are often too sour or too sweet.\nIf you prefer, you can also pour equal parts simple syrup and fresh lemon juice. This is a nice option because it allows you to adjust either ingredient to fit your taste or the particular apricot spirit you're using. For instance, with a sweeter apricot liqueur or brandy, I'd back off the syrup a bit and make up for it with more lemon.\nThe other option is to skip the sweetness altogether and use lemon alone as we see in the Scotch Sour. \nHow Strong Is the Apricot Sour?\nThe apricot-flavored liquor you choose (or can find) is going to determine how strong the Apricot Sour really is. With all the options, it's a bit of an unknown because some sweet fruit 'brandies' and liqueurs are 50 to 60-proof (or lower) while true apricot brandies tend to be 80-proof.\n\nLet's take the high side and assume we came across a great bottle of true 80-proof apricot brandy. In this case, the Apricot Sour is a relatively mild 15 percent ABV (30 proof). This is right in line with other sour drinks and why they're perfectly casual cocktails for happy hour, dinner parties, and the like.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/apricot-sour-cocktail-recipe-759410

Fill with ice.\nShake vigorously to ensure the egg is properly mixed.\nStrain into a collins glass filled with fresh ice.\nTop with ginger ale. Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nIf you're going to include the egg white, be safe and avoid using an egg that's been in your fridge a little too long.\nA quick test will tell you if your egg is fresh: Gently drop it into a glass of water and if it floats it's too old and unsafe. You're looking for eggs that sink to the bottom instead.\nThis is a nice drink to try out new-to-you brandies. As you explore brandy, add this recipe to your list of drinks to test out its mixability.\nRecipe Variations\nSkip the egg if you like and you will have a tall, refreshing brandy and ginger ale drink.\nAdjust the simple syrup to suit your personal taste. This may vary from one brandy to the next as well.\nRather than ginger ale, pour unsweetened soda water such as seltzer or club soda instead.\nIf you want to brighten it up, the snowball is pretty good with a squeeze of lemon or lime juice as well.\nHow Strong Is a Snowball Cocktail?\nWhen it comes to its alcohol content, the snowball is very similar to drinking a glass of wine. If you pour 80-proof brandy and include the egg, it weighs in at 14 percent ABV (28 proof). Skipping the egg increases that to 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

That's why it's recommended as a two-shot drink to share. Alternatively, you can strain it into an old-fashioned glass and enjoy it yourself.\nMake sure the espresso is chilled before adding it to the shaker. Hot coffee will melt too much ice and result in an overly diluted drink.\nIf you don't have an espresso machine, freshly brewed coffee will do in a pinch. Better yet, get an intense flavor of coffee that's already chilled by trying a cold brew coffee. It's incredibly easy, you just need to plan ahead because it takes about 12 hours to brew.\nSilver tequilas are preferred because the deep flavors of the coffee will mask any flavor nuance imparted by aging a reposado tequila. If you're going to use a tequila other than Patron, be sure it's the silver (blanco) style.\nThis shot will taste good with any coffee liqueur (including Kahlua), though Patron XO Caf? is one of the better choices because of its tequila base.\nRecipe Variations\nThis is an excellent drink to serve on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass.\nIt would be a lot of fun to serve this shot as a two-part drink similar to the pickleback with an espresso chaser! Simply shake the tequila and coffee liqueur and strain it into a shot glass. Have a second shot glass or demitasse cup (espresso cup) filled with either chilled or hot espresso. Drink the tequila shot, then chase it with espresso.\nHow Strong Is a Wake the Dead Shot?\nNot only is this a high-octane shot, but it's also among the strongest shooters you can mix up. When made according to the recipe, it should have an alcohol content around 25 percent ABV (50 proof).\nDo be cautious: As seen countless times with drinks like the vodka Red Bull, the effects of caffeine (or energy drink alternatives) can mask the effects of the alcohol. It is really easy to become drunker faster with drinks like this because you're so hyped up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/wake-the-dead-recipe-shooter-760796

Goldschl?ger is the only cinnamon schnapps that has gold flakes and Captain Morgan plays up the ""pirate"" effect.\nIf you switch either brand, you might have problems getting distinct layers in your shot. That\'s because the specific gravity of these two spirits is so dynamic (the schnapps is filled with sugars, so it\'s very heavy) that the rum naturally wants to float on top of the schnapps. Other brands may have slightly different specific gravities, so you might lose the effect to some extent.\nDon\'t have a bar spoon? Grab a regular teaspoon from your silverware drawer and pour the rum over the back of that.\nSince no ice is involved in making the drink, serving this shot in a chilled shot glass is a great option. The spirits will instantly cool down and that can make the shot go down easier.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you\'re not a fan of spiced rum, you can pour an aged rum instead. As long as you stay with one around 80-proof, the specific gravity should be nearly the same, so the layers should come out fairly well. White rum can also be used, but you won\'t have the brown color on top.\nYou can also make this shot with tequila or whiskey. Either should float rather nicely on top of the thick schnapps, though the taste will be entirely different.\nHow Strong Is the Pirate\'s Treasure?\nWith no dilution to factor in, the pirate\'s treasure is as strong as the two liquors combined. Captain Morgan is 35 percent ABV (70 proof) and Goldschl?ger is stronger at 43.5 percent ABV (87 proof), so the shot has an alcohol content of 39 percent ABV (78 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSuperfine sugar has a finer grain than standard white sugar, making a more delicate rim. There's no need to hunt it down at the grocery store. You can make superfine sugar from regular sugar with the help of a food processor (a blender will work, too).\nThere is a nice variety of pear-flavored vodkas available on the market today. Grey Goose La Poire is one of the best options and a top choice for this martini. You can also find the flavor from Absolut, Breckenridge Distillery, Burnett's, Skyy, Smirnoff, and Wild Roots.\nIt's also easy to make your own pear vodka. Choose your favorite vodka and cut up a couple of pears. Combine the two and allow it to infuse for 1 to 3 days until it reaches your ideal flavor.\nIf you prefer a DIY project, you can make your own elderflower cordial to use as a substitute for St. Germain.\nYou really cannot go wrong with your choice of Champagne?actually, any sparkling wine will make a great drink.\nWhen reading wine labels, the most important thing to remember is the difference between brut and sec: Brut is dry and sec is sweet. Pouring one or the other will slightly change the tone of the martini.\nHow Strong Is the French Pear Martini?\nThe French pear martini recipe looks sweet and innocent, but all of the ingredients contain alcohol. Though mild, it may not be as weak a drink as you think, mixing up to around 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

There are many ways to put a twist on a lighter sangria. Try some of these versions:\nJust Peachy Sangria: This sangria uses fresh peaches and peach schnapps, living up to its name. If you can find fresh mango, that adds a sweet and tropical flair. \nNew Zealander Sangria: This sangria is light and refreshing. It's a simple recipe since wine is the only alcohol, but its flavor is enhanced with kiwi and tangerine.\nPassionfruit Sangria: The passionfruit sangria includes the tropical fruit in juice form, so it can be made year-round. The recipe also uses brandy, kiwi, and pineapple.\nWhite Lightning Sangria: This sangria gets an extra kick from vodka and incorporates grape juice, fresh apples, grapes, and pineapple in this tasty beverage. \nSwap lemon-lime soda for ginger ale, or flavored seltzer.\nWhat Kind of Wine Should I Use?\nAny dry white wine will work in this recipe. Choose something that you enjoy drinking and will pair well with the sweet fruits. Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, and Riesling are all excellent choices, as is Pinot Grigio, especially since it's easy to find and offers a great variety of labels to choose from.

It is not a bourbon, since it is not made in Bourbon County, Kentucky according to specific criteria. There are very few bars and liquor stores in the U.S. that do not have a bottle of affordable Seagram\'s 7 with its signature red label. Seagram\'s may not be the best whiskey out there, but it is surprisingly smooth for its affordable price, and it has many dedicated fans who savor every sip. It also does the job when you are looking for a good inexpensive drink like the seven and seven.\nIs Seagram\'s 7 a Canadian Whiskey?\nThere is some debate about what style of whiskey Seagram\'s 7 is. The confusion stems from the fact that Seagram\'s is an old Canadian brand that has long produced whiskeys, vodkas, and gins at affordable prices. Pair that with the knowledge that Canada is known for producing blended whiskeys, and many drinkers are left with the impression that Seagram\'s 7 is a Canadian blended whiskey. But look at the label on a bottle of Seagram\'s 7 and it clearly states ""American whiskey?a blend of distinctive character"" that it is bottled and blended by The 7 Crown Distilling Company of Norwalk, Connecticut.\nHow Strong Is the Seven and Seven?\nEverything about the seven and seven is laid out except how much 7-Up goes into the drink.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSpearmint is a favorite mint variety for mojitos and the type you\'ll likely get from generically labeled ""mint"" at produce markets. Yerba buena is considered the mint of choice for an authentic Cuban mojito.\nSuperfine sugar is recommended because the finer crystals dissolve better in cold cocktails. With the help of your food processor or blender, it\'s easy to make superfine sugar from standard sugar.\nIf you don\'t have a muddler, use the back of a wooden spoon to mash the ingredients.\nAlthough any club soda will suffice, try a boutique soda instead. There are many great options available today, and some brands formulate sodas specifically for cocktails.\nVariations and Substitutions\nUse a different sweetener, such as raw sugar or palm (coconut) sugar; for best results, process them into finer grains. A splash of simple syrup, honey syrup, or agave nectar works well, too.\nAdd a soft layer of flavor with lightly sweetened or flavored sodas. Many hard seltzers are good alternatives to club soda, and tonic water gives it a drier profile.\nFor a fruity twist, muddle in extra fruits. Pineapple, watermelon, and raspberry mojitos are favorites. Use a combination of pomegranate seeds and juice for a delicious pomegranate mojito.\nTry a mojito sangria, a simple pitcher drink with white wine.\nMake a virgin mojito by skipping the rum and filling the glass with soda.\nHow Strong Is the Mojito?\nThe mojito is not a terribly strong cocktail. When made with 80-proof rum, the alcohol content falls in the 13 percent ABV (26 proof) range. That makes it equivalent to a glass of wine, only far more refreshing.\nWhere Was the Mojito Invented?\nThe mojito originated in Cuba, possibly derived from a 16th-century medicinal tonic known as El Draque (named after Sir Francis Drake). It\'s said that in the 1800s, Africans who had been enslaved and working in Cuba\'s sugarcane fields commonly took a similar elixir. As it advanced from tonic to beverage, the mint, lime, and sugar masked the taste of cheap rum. Havana lays claim to inventing the cocktail as it\'s known today with the introduction of ice and soda. The mojito grabbed international attention when Americans flocked to Cuba during Prohibition. It was supposedly second to the daiquiri on Ernest Hemmingway\'s list of favorite cocktails. Over the years, the rum improved, and the mojito\'s fame spread immensely.\nWhat Is the Best Rum for a Mojito?\nWhite rums are typically preferred for a mojito; it\'s good to choose a mid-range brand. Alternatively, add extra depth to the drink\'s flavor with a high-end aged rum. Avoid spiced rums because the spices detract from the freshness of the mint and lime.\nEssential Rum Cocktails You Have to Taste']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mojito-cocktail-recipe-759319

A touch of ginger ale or club soda makes almost any punch a little more appealing.\nRecipe Variations\nThe salty dog can quickly be enhanced with just a few drops of fruit bitters. You will be amazed at the subtle difference this can make.\nWhile great on the rocks, the salty dog makes a nice, fruity martini. Start out with 1 1/2 ounces gin, 2 ounces of grapefruit juice, and a dash of simple syrup. Shake the drink with ice and strain into a salt-rimmed cocktail glass.\nAdd an herbal touch; rosemary, mint, and basil are all perfect pairings with grapefruit. If you have fresh herbs, muddle the leaves with a dash of simple syrup in the bottom of the rimmed glass before adding ice. Another approach is to combine the herbs and syrup into a flavored simple syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Salty Dog?\nThe salty dog is a casual drink because of the juice volume.

In a glass container, combine the hot water and gum arabic. Stir well and allow it to stand until the powder has dissolved. This will take a few hours. When ready, the gum arabic will have soaked up the water and become a sticky paste reminiscent of glue. Stir again until it becomes smooth. Set aside.\nIn a saucepan, combine the sugar with the remaining 1/2 cup of water. Heat to maintain a slow boil and stir constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved.\nLower the heat to a simmer and add the gum paste. Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring continually, until a very thick syrup forms. Use a spoon to remove any foam buildup on the surface.\nRemove from the heat and allow to cool.\nStrain through cheesecloth or a fine-mesh sieve.\nBottle in a glass container with a tight seal and store in the refrigerator. Use in your favorite drinks and enjoy.\nTips\nThe color of the syrup will vary with the gum arabic you use. Some will produce a light, nearly clear syrup, while others may result in a darker syrup similar to honey or agave nectar.\nGum arabic is relatively expensive and can be inconsistent, so it's a good idea to start with small batches (like this recipe) and try it out in a few cocktails. Once you find your ideal syrup formula, you can make larger batches.\nMake Flavored Gomme Syrup\nJust like simple syrup, you can add flavor to gomme syrup. It's a great mixer that some cocktail recipes rely on. A classic pisco punch, for instance, uses pineapple gomme syrup, and raspberry gomme syrup is an excellent alternative to raspberry liqueur in drinks like the Floradora. There are a couple of ways to add flavor to gomme syrup, and it will require some experimentation.\nSteep fruits, herbs, spices, or citrus zest in the syrup as it cools (they can be added while simmering). The infusion time needed will range from hours to days, depending on the ingredient and quantity used. Taste it regularly and strain the syrup once it reaches your desired flavor.\nUse fruit juice as a portion of the water. Start small by adding just 1/8 cup to the boiling water (not the gum paste).\nAdd a subtle flavoring with orange flower water, rose water, or a flavored extract. Ensure the ingredient is food grade and add it to the cooling syrup in very small amounts (about 1/8 teaspoon at a time) to taste.\nHow Is Gum Arabic Used in Food?\nGum arabic is colorless, odorless, and water soluble, derived from certain types of acacia trees. It is commonly used as a stabilizer, emulsifier, and thickening agent in foods, and to stabilize flavors in beverages. Gum arabic has many uses beyond food, including in the manufacturing of watercolor paints and incense. For that reason, it is important that the gum arabic you buy for syrup is food safe. It can be found at many natural food stores or baking specialty stores and, just to be safe, it's best to purchase it from a food source. If you want to try gomme syrup, without hunting down gum arabic, you can find bottled gum syrup from a few specialty syrup producers.\nIngredients""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/make-your-own-gomme-syrup-760290

A member of the Gosling family, that was known for making spirits, was sailing from England to Virginia in 1806, but due to a lack of wind, he ended up docking his ship in Bermuda instead. There, he continued his family\'s tradition and developed Gosling\'s rum. Several years later, British naval officers created ginger beer as a way to ease seasickness and mixed the beverage with Gosling\'s rum. It is said that a sailor commented the drink looked like ¡°the color of a cloud only a fool or a dead man would sail under,¡± and the name ""dark \'n stormy"" was born. At one point, Gosling\'s trademarked the dark \'n stormy, which means, legally, it should only be made with their rum.\n\nBarritt\'s is (according to the brand) ""Bermuda\'s Favourite Soft Drink"" and is the choice for an authentic dark \'n stormy. It is interesting to note that in Gosling\'s official recipe (complete with the trademark symbol), they use their own ginger beer called Gosling\'s Stormy Ginger Beer. There is no mention of Barritt\'s.\nHow Strong Is the Dark \'n Stormy?\nIf you were to mix a dark \'n stormy as prescribed with Gosling\'s and Barritt\'s and no lime juice, then it is a relatively mild mixed drink. Gosling\'s may be dark, but it is still just 80 proof, so the finished drink weighs in right around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/dark-n-stormy-recipe-759637

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAs always, feel free to use your favorite vodka in this drink. It's a fabulously fresh recipe that will show off any vodka you choose to pour.\nChoose the freshest strawberries for this cocktail. Rinse them in water and remove the stems. Cut each berry into about four or five slices to make muddling easier.\nFrozen strawberries will do. They're often already mashed, so let them warm up a bit. Muddling will break up any remaining ice and release the juice. The drink isn't as neat looking as it is with fresh berries, but you still get the delicious taste.\nLemonade is incredibly easy to make at home. All you need is lemon juice, sugar, and water. You will find that a homemade lemonade makes a superior cocktail, whether for this recipe and any other you wish to make. Plus, you can control the balance between the sweet and tart flavors to suit your taste perfectly.\nRecipe Variations\nAdd a little sparkle by splitting the water in your lemonade with club soda or sparkling water. You can also add a splash to the glass.\nMake this a pitcher drink by increasing all of the ingredients in proportion.\nTo preserve berries that are nearing the end of their prime, make a strawberry syrup to use in this recipe. For a single drink, start with about one ounce of syrup and adjust it to taste.\nAnother option is to use strawberry syrup when making the lemonade: use it to replace the sugar syrup. It's an excellent option for a big batch, too.\nYou can also build on the berry flavor by adding other fresh fruits as they come into season. Raspberries and blackberries are fun additions, as are blueberries and other fruits like apricot and mango. \nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Vodka Lemonade?\nAs long as you pour at least three ounces of lemonade, the strawberry vodka lemonade is a relatively mild cocktail. With an 80-proof vodka, it has an alcohol content of about 12 percent ABV (24 proof). This is average for tall drinks and why it's perfect for casual sipping.\nVodka Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/strawberry-berryoska-recipe-760977

The glass should now be two-thirds full.\nUsing the same technique, float the blue cura?ao on top of the cr?me de cacao to fill the glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nThe exact amount of each ingredient you'll need will vary based on the size of your shot glasses. Don't worry so much about measuring each ingredient. Instead, visually divide your glass into thirds and pour accordingly straight from the bottles.\nTo minimize the stream, you can place pour spouts in the tops of the liquor bottles and/or use your finger to partially block the opening to create more of a drip.\nThe specific gravity of cr?me de cacao and blue cura?ao will vary by brand. The difference can be significant, and your layers may not be as distinct with some combinations.\nIf you have a liqueur combo that is not layering well, try reversing the two liqueurs. The shot will look different, but the taste will be the same.\nHow Does Layering Work?\nThe science behind layering shots is all about the density of each ingredient. Those that have a high sugar content are denser and will fall to the bottom of the glass, while liquor with a low sugar content?and a higher alcohol content?will float. But the technique in which the ingredients are poured also matters, which is why pouring very slowly over the top of the back of a spoon is recommended. When the tip of the spoon rests just above the lower layer, and the liquor is poured over very slowly, the flow is restricted, allowing the liquid to sit on top instead of mixing into the other layer.\nRecipe Variations\nThe color combination found in the red, white, and blue shot can be created in a few different ways. By switching out the liquors and ensuring the lightest remain on top, you can get the same effect with different flavors.\nReplacing the cr?me de cacao with peach schnapps is a popular variation, though its effectiveness will vary by brand. Low-proof options like Arrow Peach Schnapps will not float between the blue cura?ao and grenadine, while DeKuyper Peachtree will layer up because it's twice the alcohol content.\nIn the Fourth of July shot, blue cura?ao becomes the middle layer and vodka tops off the shot.\nThe Superman shot is very popular as well. Many versions don't include a white layer, opting for yellow instead to mimic Superman's suit.\nHow Strong Is the Red, White, and Blue Shot?\nLayered shot drinks have no dilution because the ingredients are poured straight from the bottle. Typically, the absence of ice creates a rather strong drink, but that's not the case here because the two liqueurs are relatively low-proof. On average, the shot's alcohol content will be 14 percent ABV (28 proof), or just slightly more powerful than a glass of wine.\nThe Ultimate Cocktails Guide""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-white-and-blue-shot-759785

You\'ll also find that Regans Orange Bitters No. 6 adds an interesting citrus note that\'s enjoyable as well.\nFor the cherry, try to avoid the neon red maraschinos that are so common. They\'re actually bleached and dyed that color, so they\'re as far away from ""natural"" as a cherry can get. It may only be a garnish, but it can ruin an otherwise perfect cocktail.\nInstead, look for real maraschinos soaking in maraschino liqueur or brandy, make your own maraschinos, or switch to an orange twist garnish.\nRecipe Variations\nAs with any Manhattan-inspired cocktail, adjust the whiskey to vermouth ratio to suit your taste. You might enjoy a little more sweet vermouth or just a hint of it.\nServe this drink on the rocks if you prefer. Typically, a whiskey drink such as this is best with a single large piece of ice (e.g., an ice ball). These tend to dilute very slowly and will let you enjoy the full taste of the cocktail in a slightly chilled form.\nYou can also make a ""perfect"" Irish Manhattan. Simply split the sweet vermouth in half and make up the difference with dry vermouth.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Manhattan?\nCocktails in the martini family are rarely light drinks. In fact, they\'re some of the most potent you can mix up. This one follows suit and will have an alcohol content of 29 percent ABV (58 proof).

Avoid boiling or simmering.\nStir occasionally to make sure that the honey or sugar has dissolved completely. When the wine is steaming and the ingredients have been infused, it is ready to serve.\nLadle the mulled wine into mugs. Leave the whole seasonings behind, or strain the mulled wine before serving. Garnish each mug with a slice of orange and a stick of cinnamon. Enjoy!\nTips\nA fruit-forward wine is best for this recipe. Wines with very nuanced flavors will be lost to the spices, brandy, and fruit. Try a dark, fruity red wine such as a cabernet sauvignon, tempranillo, grenache, zinfandel, or merlot. Choose a bottle of wine that you'd drink as-is: the quality of the mulled wine depends on the quality of the wine. A moderately-priced, good quality wine will do just fine, but avoid cheap or boxed wines as they'll yield a low-quality spiced wine.\nHow to Store and Freeze Mulled Wine\nYou can mull the wine 2 to 3 days ahead of when you would like to consume it. Let it cool completely, transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate. When you are ready, reheat it on the stovetop over low heat.\nYou can also freeze mulled wine. Try freezing it in ice cube trays, or in a separate container. Its flavor may slightly alter during the freezing and thawing process. You can reheat it and drink it hot, or turn it into a wine slushie.\nMaking Large Batches of Mulled Wine\n\nTo double the recipe, use two bottles of wine (or one magnum) and double the remaining ingredients. However, start with half the amount of honey or sugar, taste halfway through the cooking process, and adjust if needed. The honey can make a very sweet beverage, and when cooking the wine, the flavor can get too intense.\nTransfer the mixture to a slow cooker or leave in a pot on the lowest possible setting to keep warm without overcooking. If the mixture spends too much time on the heat, the flavor can become too intense since some of the water evaporates off.\nToss in a few whole, fresh cranberries at the end for a festive look.\nHow Strong is a Mug of Mulled Wine?\nMulled wine without brandy has an average ABV of eight to 13 percent (26 proof) per mug, like a normal glass of wine (in a 5-ounce serving). But when spiced with Brandy at 60 percent ABV (120 proof) the alcohol content can increase to 16 to 18 percent (32 to 36 proof) per mug. Consider that there's going to be some evaporation, but not enough to considerably diminish the percentage of alcohol.\n20 Festive Christmas Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mulled-wine-recipe-3510986

Your average 80-proof rum will not light on fire and, if it does, the effect will not be the same. The key to getting a good flame is to use a high-proof rum because it has a higher concentration of flammable alcohol. That is why 151-proof rums are recommended. You can find it from brands like Cruzan and Goslings at almost any liquor store.\nWhile it may be tempting to use grain alcohol like Everclear, it defeats the purpose of the flaming Dr. Pepper. Yes, the liquor is 151-proof (or higher) and it will start on fire, but the point of this shot is to recreate the taste of Dr. Pepper and rum is the only way to do that.\nRecipe Variation\nThe other option is to build your flaming Dr. Pepper in a pint glass. You'll still need the shot glass, but this method doesn't require you to actually drop it. It is a little trickier to pour and you'll want to take your time.\n\nOne trick to pulling it off is to use a shorter pint glass that is just a little taller than your shot glass. Tall pints don't leave you much room to maneuver.\nPour the amaretto into a shot glass until it's 3/4 full and float the rum on top.\nPlace this glass inside a larger glass. \nCarefully pour beer around the edges until it almost reaches the rim of the shot.\nLight the rum on fire (use a long lighter if needed) and let it burn for about 30 seconds.\nExtinguish the flame and slam the drink. (Take care that the shot glass doesn't chip a tooth.)\nSafety First\nWith any flaming drink, there are some precautions you should take. It is not uncommon for someone to lean over the flame and catch their hair or shirt sleeve on fire. Also, you don't want any flaming liquor to spill on your bar.\nExtinguish the flame before consuming the drink. It's just the smart thing to do because the burning alcohol can run down your chin and start your clothes on fire. In the least, you'll singe some nose hairs.\nDo not make this drink when you are already drunk or serve it to someone who is. Play it smart and if you're making this at home, enjoy it at the beginning of the night when you're still with it.\nTie back long hair and get control of loose clothing before playing with fire. Do not reach over the flaming shot and keep all flammables out of the way when you go to blow it out. \nBe prepared and have a fire extinguisher ready. Seriously, nothing ruins the party faster than a fire that gets out of control.\nHow Strong Is a Flaming Dr. Pepper?\nThe flaming Dr. Pepper is notorious for contributing to some nasty hangovers, but it's really not a strong shot on its own. The actual alcohol content falls at just 11 percent ABV (22 proof), or the equivalent to a glass of wine. The more likely culprit to those morning-after pains is the party atmosphere and the fact that this shot is often just one of many drinks people slam in a night. As always, if you want to avoid the hangover, have fun but try not to get carried away.\nPeanut Butter and Jelly Shot Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/flaming-dr-pepper-shooter-recipe-760520

Try some of these to find you're ideal version:\nPour 1 1/2 ounces each of Southern Comfort and cranberry juice with 3/4 ounce of lime juice. This is perfect for a short glass and, when shaken, works as an up drink.\nSkip the lime juice and mix 2 ounces of Southern Comfort with 3 ounces of cranberry juice.\nFor a tall highball, try 2 ounces of Southern Comfort, a splash of lime, and up to 6 ounces of cranberry juice.\nAdding a clear soda (e.g., club soda, ginger ale, or lemon-lime) makes it more refreshing. It's also an excellent addition when transforming the Scarlett O'Hara into a party punch.\nHow Strong Is the Scarlett O'Hara?\nSouthern Comfort can vary in strength. In the U.S., it is often 70-proof, but there are 80-proof and 100-proof bottles available. When made with 80-proof SoCo and 2 ounces of juice, the Scarlett O'Hara's alcohol content falls around 16 percent ABV (32 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nHow to Create the Jungle Bird Garnish\nCut a pineapple ring that\'s about 1/2-inch thick then cut it into triangular wedges. Pull a few leaves of varying sizes from the pineapple and stack them up on top of one another; place the shortest on top and line up the white ends. Use a cocktail skewer to pin a maraschino cherry on top of the leaves and through the pineapple wedge. Fan out the leaves to mimic a bird\'s tail feathers and rest the garnish inside the glass.\nTips\nLike many popular cocktails, everyone seems to have their own preference for the rum in the jungle bird. Dark rum is recommended over white rum, and the bold flavors of Jamaican rum is a favorite. You might also want to try a blackstrap (e.g., Cruzan), Goslings Black Seal, or Bacardi Dark.\nThe jungle bird is almost always served over a single large piece of ice. It\'s easy to find 2-inch square molds, or you can use an ice ball. Either way, it will keep your drink refreshingly cold while minimizing the dilution.\nFor the lime juice, it\'s easiest to squeeze the juice of half a lime directly into the shaker.\nTo balance out the drink\'s flavor, use a rich simple syrup (2 parts sugar to 1 part water). White sugar works well, and demerara sugar is an excellent choice, too.\nFresh pineapple juice is also recommended and you\'ll get the highest yield from an electric juicer. A muddler is not as efficient, but it will work: Place about 1 cup of pineapple cubes in the shaker and muddle very well to get as much juice as possible. Leave the pineapple in the shaker and continue mixing the drink (the agitation will help produce more juice).\nWho Created the Jungle Bird Cocktail?\nThe first written recipe for the jungle bird was unearthed by Jeff ""Beachbum"" Berry in ""The New American Bartender\'s Guide"" (originally published in 1989), which he wrote about in the book ""Intoxica"" (2003). Though the drink\'s creation date is often attributed to 1978, Kim Choong1\ufeff\ufeff traced it to the earlier part of that decade from people who worked at the Kuala Lumpur Hilton. It was most likely invented around 1973 by beverage manager Jeffrey Ong when the hotel opened. Served as a welcoming drink to guests, it was named in honor of The Aviary Bar\'s apparently impressive display of captive birds. Once rediscovered, bartenders became enamored by the Malaysian cocktail\'s intertwining of classic and tiki cocktail styles, as well as its ease of preparation. Today, it appears on drink menus in bars that otherwise shy away from tropical drinks and has inspired a number of modern twists.\nHow Strong Is a Jungle Bird?\nDark rums can vary in intensity, so the jungle bird\'s alcohol content will as well. However, it\'s always going to be a relatively mild cocktail and just a little stronger than a glass of wine. For example, when made with 80 proof rum, it weighs in around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jungle-bird-cocktail-4687092

A good default is aromatic bitters, such as Angostura, though mint bitters make an equally nice complement. If you're feeling a little wild, orange bitters are quite interesting for the palate as well.\nGreen cr?me de menthe is preferred over the white (clear) version because of the color it brings to the drink. However, you can pour white cr?me de menthe and enjoy the exact same taste.\nFor the gin, it's customary to shake a traditional London dry gin in this drink. You can, however, find some interesting flavors by exploring other options, including some of the newer craft gins that are a little less juniper-forward.\nThe Botanist Islay Dry Gin would be an interesting bottle to try. Three types of mint are among the 22 foraged botanicals used to create this unique Scottish gin.\nRecipe Variation\nThe Caruso is a cocktail recipe that's very similar to the Emerald Isle, though it adds dry vermouth to the mix. To make it, stir 1 ounce each of gin and dry vermouth with a dash of green cr?me de menthe in an ice-filled shaker. Strain it into a chilled cocktail glass. If you use white cr?me de menthe, it becomes a Caruso Blanco. Bitters are a good addition as well.\nHow Strong Is an Emerald Isle Cocktail?\nThe Emerald Isle is served as a very short drink because of its distinct flavor (one round will likely be enough for most people) as well as its potency.

While still holding the glass upside down, roll the rim in a dish of grated chocolate, cocoa powder, or finely crushed graham crackers.\nIn a cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes, pour the cream, white cr?me de cacao, and green cr?me de menthe.\nShake well.\nStrain into the prepared cocktail glass. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe suggestion of white and green liqueurs creates a pale green cocktail. However, if you use either brown cr?me de cacao or white cr?me de menthe, the drink will not have its signature color.\nChilling the glass makes the grasshopper even smoother and will keep it cold longer. Start off with a frosted glass (place it in the freezer for half an hour or so) then return it to the freezer after rimming for a last-minute chill.\nRecipe Variations\nOne popular variation you'll find from Tujague's includes a brandy float on top of the creamy green cocktail.\nShortly after the grasshopper spread throughout the country, Bryant's Cocktail Lounge in Milwaukee started using ice cream rather than heavy cream.\nGive the grasshopper an extra kick by adding vodka. Pour the same 3/4 ounce as the other ingredients to maintain a balance of flavor.\nYou can also add a flavored vodka into the mix. There are many great options to choose from; espresso vodkas, whipped cream, and other dessert vodkas are good choices. Chocolate vodka will double up on the cocoa flavor.\nThe grasshopper shooter is everything that's great about the original grasshopper in a tasty little party shot.\nThe peppermint patty uses a different combination of liquors to get the same mint-chocolate taste. It's typically served on the rocks and there's a hot chocolate version, too.\nIf you have RumChata in your bar, try the mint chocochata martini. The irresistible taste of creamy chocolate and mint remains for an equally delicious cocktail.\nIn the holiday hopper recipe, you'll find a surprising twist with an extra layer of flavor that's quite interesting.\nHow Strong Is the Grasshopper?\nThe grasshopper is a fantastic low-proof cocktail, making it a yummy casual drink that shouldn't leave you feeling tipsy. If you choose 40-proof liqueurs, it weighs in with an alcohol content of just 13 percent ABV (26 proof). That's equivalent to the average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/grasshopper-cocktail-recipe-759305

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a shot glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nIn any grasshopper recipe, the key to a brilliant green drink is to choose the right liqueurs. Cr?me de menthe comes in green and white, while cr?me de cacao has dark and white options. Both ""white"" liqueurs are clear, and none of the liqueurs are creamy (cr?me means it has a lot of sugar). While different combinations will create the same mint-chocolate taste, it\'s not always aesthetically pleasing.\nWith that in mind, the best-looking grasshopper comes from green cr?me de menthe and white cr?me de cacao. If you pour the darker chocolate liqueur, your shot will look muddy?more like a swamp rather than a field of clover.\nIf you don\'t have light cream in stock, use whatever creamy ingredient you have on hand. It could be half and half, heavy cream, milk, or a dairy alternative such as almond, rice, or soy milk.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you have no cacao in the bar, but you do have a chocolate vodka, go ahead and use that. Some are brown and will mess with the color, but the flavor will be the same. This substitute will create a stronger shot as well, so take it a little easier than usual.\nNo dairy products in the bar? Turn to your favorite cream liqueur?Irish cream and RumChata are great options?and pour that instead.\nHow Strong Is the Grasshopper Shot?\nThe average cr?me de menthe and cacao liqueurs are 50 proof. That makes the alcohol content of the grasshopper an easy one to estimate. When mixed according to the recipe, this shot should weigh in at 13 percent ABV (26 proof). It\'s similar to a glass of wine, only far more delicious, which is why it\'s best to be cautious about taking too many shots.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/grasshopper-shot-recipe-759684

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nAn aged rum adds depth to this recipe and is highly recommended. You can also pour any gold or darker colored rum, though white rums don\'t have the same character that a drink like eggnog deserves.\nMake sure your egg is fresh. Give the egg a quick test by placing the egg in a glass of water; if it sinks, it\'s fresh and will be safe to drink. Eggs that float to the top are too old and should be discarded.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than ruby port, pour another dark liqueur such as amaretto, Frangelico, or B?n?dictine. Any nutty or spiced flavors will complement the eggnog just as well as the port.\nPour brandy or whiskey instead of rum. Both are popular liquors for eggnog and will pair nicely with the port in this recipe, too.\nYou can try this eggnog with an egg substitute, such as Egg Beaters. These are typically made primarily of egg whites and will reduce the fat and cholesterol in the drink. The whites will create a creamy drink, it just won\'t have the ""eggy"" flavor that the yolks contribute.\nEgg replacers designed for vegan and egg allergy diets will not work in eggnog. Instead, you\'ll want to use a dedicated vegan eggnog recipe.\nHow Strong Is an Easy Rum Eggnog?\nUnless you overpour the liquor?which happens frequently?the majority of eggnog is about the same strength as a glass of wine.

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nSince there is no ice in this cocktail, it's best made with pre-chilled ingredients. You can also quick-freeze the cranberries in your freezer for an hour so they act like fruity ice cubes.\nRecipe Variation\nIt is very simple to transform this Christmas mimosa into a tasty mocktail by replacing the liqueur and wine with non-alcoholic ingredients. Go with a pomegranate juice or pour a pomegranate-cranberry juice blend (it's likely more economical) and top it with a sparkling cider or white grape juice. You get the same great flavors, but none of the alcohol!\nThe Flavor of Pine\nAdding pine to cocktails is not a new thing whatsoever. After all, juniper berries are the key ingredient in gin and a warm cup of pine tea is great in the winter. In modern mixology, many bartenders have experimented with adding fresh pine to cocktails and the results are quite impressive.\nThe pine used in the Christmas mimosa is very gentle in comparison to other applications. By simply garnishing the drink with a single sprig, that piney flavor softly adds dimension to the cocktail. It should not become overwhelming because you'll be drinking as it infuses. You can always remove the garnish once the flavor hits your desired taste. \nChoose Your Pine Carefully\nThere is some caution when it comes to selecting an edible pine, however. While the majority of pine and fir trees are safe for people, there are a few that are toxic. It's important that you properly identify any evergreen you're going to take a cutting from.\nThe trees to avoid include hemlock, Norfolk Island pine (or Australian pine), and Ponderosa pine (not all of these are true pines, either). Common pine trees like the white pine, any spruce, and balsam and Douglas firs are safe and among your best choices.\nAdditionally, women who are pregnant should not drink or eat any pine. Keep this in mind when serving the mocktail and use an alternative garnish.\nIf you're not up for foraging for the proper pine, rosemary is a perfect substitution! It adds more of a warm, floral flavor, but creates an equally festive Christmas cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Christmas Mimosa?\nThis mimosa is pleasantly gentle, which is why it's a great choice for brunch. On average, its alcohol content is just 11 percent ABV (22 proof), or about the same as the sparkling wine you pour into it.\nThe Ultimate Cocktails Guide""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cranberry-mimosa-recipe-4154587

Don't go too low in quality though; choose a good mid-range tequila that you wouldn't mind drinking straight.\nFresh lime juice is best and it should be adjusted to your personal taste. With different tequilas, you may need a little more or a little less.\nIf you like a tart drink, make this cocktail with blanco tequila and rub the lime garnish around the rim of the glass for an extra bite with each sip.\nTo ensure your drinks are always carbonated, buy soda in smaller bottles unless you'll be making a lot of drinks in a short period of time. Chill the club soda and open it very slowly because it fizzes up and will easily overflow.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you switch the club soda to grapefruit soda, you'll have created a paloma. You can also squeeze a little fresh grapefruit juice into the tequila soda for an extra hint of citrus.\nInfuse the tequila soda with flavor by using a flavored tequila. For instance, apple-cinnamon tequila makes an excellent autumn drink, while lemongrass-ginger tequila adds an interesting background flavor. Eliminate the lime if the flavors don't match.\nMake a tequila collins by switching to lemon juice and sweetening the drink with agave nectar.\nThe tamarind and tequila is a similar sparkling highball, made with tamarind nectar, simple syrup, and ginger ale.\nHow Strong Is a Tequila Soda?\nThe tequila soda is a relatively mild cocktail, and pouring more or less soda will change the strength.

The liqueur company was responsible for creating the blue version of the orange liqueur, which is initially clear in color. Another good option is Genuine Curacao Liqueur by Senior. Try to steer clear of really cheap options because they can be very syrup-like. In fact, some blue cura?ao has no alcohol but is a drink syrup (most liquor stores keep these in the mixer section).\nFresh pineapple juice will give you the best flavor. It's an easy fruit to juice, either with an electric juicer or by muddling a few chunks of pineapple then straining off the juice. It doesn't take much to get 1/2 ounce.\nIf you are using fresh pineapple, you can also use a slice of pineapple as a garnish.\nHow Strong Is an Envy Cocktail?\nThe envy cocktail is a beautiful and tasty drink but it packs a big punch.

It is a very popular flavored vodka and almost every one of the most popular brands produce a vanilla vodka.\nIf you'd like to make your own vanilla vodka, it is easy to do. A homemade vanilla infusion should take just three to four days and a single vanilla bean will flavor an entire bottle. This is a nice option if you enjoy DIY projects or have a favorite vodka that does not sell a vanilla option.\nDarker chocolate liqueurs are more popular, but you should be able to find a few varieties of white chocolate liqueurs. Godiva offers one of the best-known options and it is relatively easy to find. Other options include Mozart White Chocolate Vanilla Cream and Godet Belgian White Chocolate. \nRecipe Variations\nTry rimming your glass with a mix of cocoa and sugar or crushed graham crackers to create a pie-like cocktail.\nIt's also fun when a small bar of chocolate is dunked inside or with a Hershey's Kiss waiting in the bottom of the glass.\nFor a little contrast and to give it an autumn or winter touch, go with a cinnamon stick and dusting of nutmeg.\nHow Strong Is the White Chocolatini?\nThe white chocolatini is a delightfully mild cocktail. Much of that has to do with the cream and the fact that vanilla vodkas are often 35 percent ABV (70 proof) and most chocolate liqueurs are around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).

Typically, you can squeeze the juice of half a lemon directly into the shaker, but measuring it offers more control over the flavor. Avoid bottled lemon juice for any sour drinks because they throw off the balance of flavor.\nThe egg: Before cracking your egg, test it for freshness. Place the egg in a glass of water, and if it sinks, it\'s fresh. Discard any egg that floats. The recommended 1/2 ounce of egg white is about half of the average large egg white, but it\'s best to measure this in a jigger. Add the entire egg white if you prefer a foamier drink.\nOld No-Egg Sour\nThe original gin sour from the 1880s did not include egg, which was reserved for an ""egg sour"" with brandy. Instead, the gin sour was made by dissolving a teaspoon of sugar into a splash of seltzer or still water and the juice of half a lemon, then adding 2 ounces of gin and filling the glass with ice. This same formula works for brandy, rum, whiskey, and most spirits.\nHow Strong Is a Gin Sour?\nThe gin sour is a moderately strong drink. With the egg white, it averages 18 percent ABV (36 proof) and will be slightly more robust if you skip that ingredient.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThere's no need to pull out your best vodka for a mudslide; save that for your vodka martinis. Instead, find a decent, inexpensive vodka for this drink.\nFlavored vodkas also work well in a mudslide. Try an espresso, chocolate, raspberry, or cake-flavored vodka for more sweetness and flavor.\nPouring the mudslide over fresh ice is the easiest way to improve this simple drink. The ice in the shaker is broken down from agitation. If that ice goes into the glass, your drink will be watered down by the time you are halfway done with it.\nThe ice in the glass should simply keep the drink cool while you enjoy it. Consider using ice balls or giant cubes. The larger the ice, the slower it will melt, and the less your drink will suffer from unwanted dilution.\nKeeping your vodka bottle in the freezer will also help keep your beverage cool when you make it.\nRecipe Variations\nIrish cream is an essential spirit for bars, but you can also play with some of the alternatives. RumChata is a perfect example, and if you are a fan of this dairy liqueur, you will love it in your mudslide.\nSome versions of the mudslide double up on the cream. For an extra-creamy drink, try it with 1 ounce of Irish cream liqueur and 1 1/2 ounces heavy cream.\nTo make a frozen mudslide, pour 1 ounce each of the three distilled spirits into a blender. Add 1 ounce of milk or cream, then 1 cup of ice. Blend until smooth. Pour it into a frosty hurricane glass and add a drizzle of chocolate syrup.\nFor a special dessert, swap the milk or cream for a scoop of vanilla ice cream and cut back to about 1/2 cup of ice. Blend.\nFor a fancy frozen mudslide, add layers of chocolate syrup. Pour a small amount of the drink into your glass, top that layer with syrup, then add another mudslide layer. Continue this pattern until your glass is full.\nSubstitute a blended Scotch whisky for the vodka, and you have a drink called the aggravation (or teacher's pet). It typically gets a quick shake: Pour everything into the serving glass along with ice, cover it with a shaker tin, and give it one good shake. (Make sure you have a tight grip on both the glass and the tin or things could get messy.) It can be made with cream, milk, or Irish cream.\nBrandy makes an excellent variation on the mudslide as well.\nFor an on-the-rocks variation, build your drink in a glass and stir, instead of shaking. This method will provide a little more bite and decadence.\nHow Strong Is the Mudslide?\nThough the mudslide may taste sweet and innocent, it is almost as strong as a margarita. As an example, with 80-proof vodka, Baileys, and Kahl?a, its alcohol content falls in the 29 percent ABV (58 proof) range. Since it's so yummy, it's easy to drink one too many, and this one will sneak up on you. Of course, if you were to add milk or cream or blend the mudslide, it would be far less potent.\nIs a mudslide vegan?\nSince a mudslide is made with Irish cream and coffee liqueur, the drink contains dairy. Most coffee liqueurs, including Kahl?a, contain dairy, and one of the main ingredients of Irish cream liqueurs, such as Baileys, is heavy cream. Therefore, it is not a vegan-friendly cocktail.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mudslide-cocktail-recipe-761120

Mix carefully so that you don't deflate the cream.\nServe in chilled cups or glasses and garnish with an additional sprinkle of nutmeg.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can also make spiked eggnog using store-bought eggnog. Add 1/4 to 3/4 cup of liquor per quart of eggnog (starting with the lower amount and adding more as needed). We like spiced rum, bourbon, or brandy best.\nIf you would like more potent eggnog and want to add more liquor, you will need to make a minor adjustment to maintain the right consistency: If you increase the liquor amount to 1 cup, it's recommended that you increase the heavy cream amount to 3/4 cup.\nYou can also spike vegan eggnog.\nHow to Store\nThe eggnog can be refrigerated (tightly wrapped or with a lid) for up to three days. It's better fresh?make it up to a day ahead before you plan to serve it.\nIs Eggnog Served Hot or Cold?\nEggnog is typically served cold; however, it can be served warm on a cold winter night. This eggnog recipe can technically be served as soon as the liquor and vanilla are added. However, the mixture becomes thicker and more flavorful as it chills in the fridge. If you are heating eggnog, use low heat and heat it slowly to avoid scorching the eggs or dairy.\nWhy Is My Homemade Eggnog Lumpy?\nIf your eggnog is lumpy, it's likely due to the eggs. Eggnog should be cooked on low heat very slowly and stirred often or you risk scrambling the eggs. Scrambled eggs will lead to a lumpy (rather than creamy) texture in your eggnog. If you only have a few lumps, simply strain the mixture before serving.\nHow Strong Is a Cup of Spiked Eggnog?\nThe strength of a cup of this spiked eggnog depends on how much rum, brandy, or bourbon you're using. A 6-ounce serving of this recipe that uses a total of 8 ounces of brandy weighs in around 8.8 percent ABV (17.6 proof). Because rum and whiskey have a similar alcohol content as brandy, the strength will be similar for a 6-ounce serving that used one of those two liquors.\n20 Festive Christmas Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/eggnog-with-brandy-bourbon-or-rum-1806044

Serve and enjoy.\nChoose Your Vodka\nThe Hollywood is one of those cocktails where you don\'t necessarily need to use your best vodka, but it doesn\'t hurt to make a good decision.\nI actually enjoy using this recipe when testing out new brands because it\'s always nice to see how a certain vodka plays off the contrast of fruits. For that reason, I would suggest you try it in your exploration of craft vodkas.\nIf you are on a budget, you will find that the Hollywood is a drink that will work with your cheap drink schemes as well. There are a number of great tasting and inexpensive vodkas available that will make an excellent Hollywood.\nThe Raspberry Liqueur\nWhen it comes to raspberry liqueurs, Chambord is often the first brand that comes to mind. It is an excellent option for the Hollywood and if you already have it in stock, you are one step ahead.\nThat said, you can search the liquor store shelves for alternatives because this is one flavor that has hidden gems. Raspberry is a popular liqueur flavor for craft distillers to play with and you local distillery may be producing one close to home.\nIf you are looking for luxury, try to find a bottle of Chase Raspberry Liqueur. This one is actually cheaper than Chambord and has a sweet, delectable flavor. On the budget-friendly side, Hiram Walker Fruja Raspberry is a favorite \nThe Pineapple Juice\nAs with all fruit juices, use fresh pineapple if you can. An electric juicer will make quick work of the whole fruit.\nIf you\'re buying pineapple juice, look for resealable bottles or small cans unless you are hosting a party. Pineapple juice from large cans is often a waste of perfectly good juice. If you do purchase a large can, have a container ready to store the leftover.\nHow Strong Is the Hollywood Cocktail?\nThe Hollywood can be a very gentle drink. Of course, the amount of juice you add is going to play a big role in determining this cocktail\'s strength. \n\nIf we use an 80-proof vodka with Chambord and pour about 4 ounces of pineapple to fill the glass, the Hollywood would be a mild 10 percent ABV (20 proof). That is close to the average glass of wine.\nHonor Sidney Poitier by Making a Dish from ""Guess Who¡¯s Coming to Dinner""']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-hollywood-vodka-and-pineapple-drink-recipe-761077

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nChambord is the most popular black raspberry liqueur on the market, so it is most often used in the Hollywood martini. There are other brands available, but be careful to avoid those that are too cheap as they can also be too sweet and bring down the drink\'s clean flavor. Bols Raspberry Liqueur is a great alternative and you can also look for framboise liqueurs or any type of raspberry (""black"" is not required).\nThe vodka you pour into the Hollywood martini doesn\'t have to be your best, though it will be better with premium vodka. While the fruits will mask some impurities, they won\'t cover up everything. Choose wisely and you\'ll enjoy a better tasting drink.\nFor the pineapple juice, fresh is best and it\'s easy to muddle the juice from pineapple chunks if you don\'t have a juicer. You don\'t need much for this drink, so it will not require a lot of work.\nIf you choose to buy pineapple juice, pick up the small cans. It doesn\'t keep well for long periods of time and, unless you drink a lot of pineapple, you can easily end up wasting quite a bit of juice with the bigger cans.\nRecipe Variations\nThis martini recipe is the ideal cocktail to play with flavored vodkas. You can ramp up either of the fruit flavors by pouring a pineapple or raspberry vodka, or go with another fruit. Almost any of the popular flavors work, though citrus, any berry, and pomegranate vodkas would be excellent choices. For a fun twist, try a vanilla vodka.\nTo enhance the raspberry or pineapple flavors, muddle some of the fresh fruits in your cocktail shaker before adding ice and the other ingredients. A few fresh or frozen raspberries and pineapple chunks will add a nice, fresh flavor to the drink and give the martini a new life.\nHow Strong Is the Hollywood Martini?\nWhen made with an 80-proof vodka and Chambord, the alcohol content of the Hollywood martini comes out to around 13 percent ABV (26 proof). In the world of martinis, that\'s a pretty light drink when you consider that the standard vodka martini?even a chocolate martini?weigh in over 25 percent ABV.\nHonor Sidney Poitier by Making a Dish from ""Guess Who¡¯s Coming to Dinner""']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hollywood-martini-recipe-761078

Serve and enjoy.\nThe Tequila\nThis recipe came from Casamigos Tequila and we do recommend using the drink as an introduction to this impressive tequila (more on that below). Many other premium tequilas will be just as good in the Danny Ocean, the real question may be whether a reposado tequila is necessary.\nWe gave the drink a test, putting Casamigos Reposado against Cazadores Blanco. Both were excellent drinks as each is a great tequila from Jalisco\'s highlands.\nThere was definitely an element missing with the blanco tequila, which was to be expected. That small difference which a slightly aged tequila makes is apparent and personally, we preferred the way the reposado complemented the drink\'s light fruits.\nThe Fruit Juices\nThe Danny Ocean cocktail makes another case for the \'fresh is best\' argument. Bottled lemon and grapefruit juices can make a decent drink, but one made with fresh juice is notably superior.\nThe great news? Both lemon and grapefruit are easy to juice and you don\'t need fancy juicers. A simple hand citrus juicer will do!\nThe Agave Nectar\nUsing agave nectar for any tequila cocktail is a natural choice. The two agave-based ingredients are perfect companions.\nAgave nectar is sweeter than most simple syrups. If you are going to substitute the nectar with another sweetener, you will likely have to adjust it. Typically you will use more simple syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Danny Ocean?\nThe tequila is chosen, so the only variable for estimating the Danny Ocean\'s strength is the maraschino. On average, these cherry liqueurs weigh in at about 32 percent ABV, so we\'ll use that for this example.\n\nIn this case, this fruity drink is a relatively mild 16 percent ABV (32 proof). In comparison, this is almost half the strength of the average Margarita, so enjoy!\nReview of Casamigos Reposado Tequila\nWe must preface this review with the fact that we are naturally skeptical of celebrity-backed liquor. We have seen too many times in recent years that a celebrity endorsement does little for the actual quality of spirits and quite often they are disappointments. However, we do keep an open mind when faced with any new spirit and test each on their merits, not the names behind it.\nThe Casamigos Tequila Story\nIn case you did not pick it up yet, Casamigos is the tequila brand that is backed by George Clooney. This story is a little different from simply tagging a celebrity face to a brand.\nCasamigos started out as the \'house tequila\' for Clooney, Rande Gerber (Cindy Crawford\'s husband, restaurateur, and owner of The Whiskey NYC), and Mike Meldman (land developer and owner of Discovery Land Company). The story goes that the trio of friends love tequila and wanted to have their own tequila to enjoy at their homes in Mexico.\nWorking with the distillery and master distiller behind Tequila Avion and Clase Azul (two great tequilas in their own right), the trio realized their dream and Casamigos was born. The names roughly translate from Spanish to mean ""House of Friends.""\nIt was first released in the U.S. market in 2013 and has since been distributed to other markets, including Canada, the UK, Bahamas and Hong Kong.\nHow is Casamigos Made?\nTequila production is very regulated and it is the little details that make the difference in one tequila\'s production versus another.\nCasamigos Tequila\'s production involves:\nBlue Weber agave is grown in the red clay soil of Jalisco, Mexico, an area known for producing the richest-tasting tequilas.\nDistilled at Productos Finos de Agave in Jes?s Mar?a, Jalisco.\nAgave pinas are slow-roasted for 72 hours in brick ovens.\nThe fermentation process takes 80 hours.\nCasamigos Blanco is rested for 2 months.\nCasamigos Reposado is aged for 7 months and A?ejo is aged for 14 months, both in used American whiskey oak barrels.\nThe Taste of Casamigos Tequila\nFor all the background, the really important thing you want to know is how does this tequila stack up against others, right?\nWe had the opportunity to taste Casamigos Reposado Tequila and try it in a few cocktails. The first impression is that it is a very nice tequila though slightly milder in flavor than some of its counterparts, but that seems to be what it\'s founders were going for.\nCasamigos was designed to be a sipping tequila, one that ""didn\'t have to be covered up with salt or lime."" On this point, they hit it on the mark! The reposado is a tequila that you can pour and sip to your heart\'s content. It is as smooth as a premium whiskey, has nice notes of caramel and cocoa and a silky mouthfeel and is simply a delight to drink. Everyone that we shared it with was impressed.\nThe only problem we can foresee with Casamigos is that it may get lost in some cocktails. The Danny Ocean recipe above is probably about as complex a flavor as we would use the reposado in. If you were to go any further with strong flavors, you would lose those subtle oak qualities that make it a good tequila.\nKeep the drinks light and you will love mixing with Casamigos.\nThe Verdict: Is Casamigos Worth the Money?\nCasamigos is on that fine line of expensive tequila. Compared to many of its counterparts, the brand did do an excellent job of keeping it below the $50 price point (except the a?ejo) that can be a deterrent for many drinkers. It\'s the magic number for the majority of us because once liquor passes it, it becomes a real luxury.\nWe do think that Casamigos is worth the money. It is a nice tequila that is premium but not overpriced for what it is. It\'s a tequila that you can save for those special occasions without feeling like you\'re either wasting it in a mixed drink or sacrificing your hard earned dollars.\nThough we\'ve only tasted one of the three Casamigos Tequilas, we suspect that the blanco and a?ejo follow suit with the reposado. Is this going to be a tequila for those who love the bold agave flavors? No. This is a tequila for drinkers who enjoy the softer side and it is a gentle introduction for the new tequila aficionado.\nAbout Casamigos Tequila\n100% Blue Weber agave tequilas produced in the highlands of Jalisco, Mexico\nBlanco, Reposado and A?ejo Tequilas available\nDeveloped and owned by George Clooney, Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman\nOriginally launched in 2013\nNOM 1416\nAll Casamigos Tequilas are 40% alcohol/volume (80 proof)\nRetail for around: Blanco $44.99, Reposado $49.99, A?ejo $54.99\nVisit Their Website\nDisclosure: Review samples were provided by the manufacturer.

Shake your head very fast, then swallow. You just turned your mouth into a cement mixer!\nWhat\'s Makes the Cement Mixer So Thick?\nAn interesting chemical reaction takes place when you make the cement mixer. As the shot sits, the fat of the Irish cream and the acid of the lime juice slowly combine. Within seconds, a thick, lumpy slurry is created that will get thicker over time, especially when it\'s agitated. If you need a visual, go ahead and stir it with a straw and watch the ""magic"" happen. The texture is best compared to cottage cheese or (more appropriately) uncured cement. Timing is important when drinking a cement mixer; you don\'t want to wait too long or the mix will become too thick. Also, the more lime juice you use, the chunkier it will become.\nTips\nIf you have a weak stomach or have had too much to drink already, this may not be the best time to drink a cement mixer.\nYou might want to have a glass of water available just in case you wait a little too long and the mix becomes too cement-like. A good rinse should help you recover.\nIf you have a fresh lime around, simply squeeze the juice from half the fruit into the shot glass. If you have bottled lime juice or Rose\'s Lime Cordial in the refrigerator, this is the perfect drink to use it in.\nHow Strong Is a Cement Mixer?\nThe cement mixer is not a strong shot. Essentially, you\'re just diluting Irish cream with lime juice, so pouring a 40-proof liqueur will result in a 30-proof (15 percent ABV) shot.\nRecipe Variation\nRather than mixing the two ingredients in a shot glass, some drinkers prefer to mix everything up in their mouths. Pour the Irish cream and lime juice into separate shot glasses. Begin with the Irish cream and pour both shots into your mouth (don\'t swallow yet). Shake your head really fast to mix everything up, then swallow.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cement-mixer-shot-recipe-759617

Don\'t get offended if your bartender says ""no."" Simply order something else.\nIf you prefer to skip the shake, pour the Yukon Jack directly into a shot glass and add a splash of lime. This will create a significantly stronger shot in both taste and alcohol content because it\'s undiluted. \nRose\'s Lime Cordial (or Sweetened Lime Juice) is specifically called for in the snakebite. Use another sweet lime juice, make your own lime cordial, or simply use fresh lime juice if you prefer.\nIs Yukon Jack a Whiskey or a Liqueur?\nYukon Jack is often mistakenly referred to as a Canadian whiskey. Look closely at the bottle, and you will notice that it\'s ""Canadian Liqueur."" While it does have a whiskey base, once the sugar is added (and there\'s a lot in Yukon Jack), it becomes a liqueur. To be exact, Yukon Jack is a honey-flavored Canadian whiskey-based liqueur.\n\nThis is a unique liqueur, and the brand\'s tagline is ""The Black Sheep of Canadian Liquors."" It also has a rugged, not-so-good reputation. Much of this comes from its appearance in drinks like the snakebite as well as the high alcohol content. Two versions of Yukon Jack are sold: 100-proof in the U.S. and 80-proof in Canada. As with all whiskeys and spirits, the higher proof amplifies the flavor because it is not as diluted. That doesn\'t help Yukon Jack go down any easier. \nHow Strong Is the Snakebite?\nWhen any shot is made almost entirely of 100-proof liquor, it is not going to be a weak drink, and the snakebite is no exception. After shaking, the snakebite may get down to 40 percent ABV (80 proof), which is equivalent to the average shot of straight whiskey. If you choose not to shake it, just assume that you\'re downing a full-strength, 100-proof drink. While one snakebite may be fun and get a few laughs, two might cause quite the hangover. Drinking three or more snakebites in one night is not recommended.\nHow Is the Beer and Cider Snakebite Made?\nThe Yukon Jack snakebite is a North American recipe, but there\'s also a snakebite that\'s popular in the United Kingdom. It\'s a completely different drink, but it packs an equally potent punch. It was a big hit in the 1980s and continues to have some appeal, though not all British pubs will serve it because of its reputation of getting patrons drunk rather quickly.\n\nThe British snakebite is a layered beer drink, similar to the black and tan. To make it, simply fill a pint glass halfway with hard cider, then slowly pour a lager on top. Sometimes a stout is used instead, though the crispness of a lager is an arguably better fit for cider. It\'s also common to pour a shot of black currant liqueur (e.g., cr?me de cassis) on top; this variation goes by the names snakebite and black, diesel, or purple nasty.\nBest-Tasting Party Shots']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/snakebite-yukon-jack-shot-761498

While you might be used to including a whole orange wedge?peel and all?in other drinks, it's best to remove the grapefruit peel before adding it to your drink.\nTo really enhance this drink's flavor, muddle the grapefruit to extract more of the tart juice. Do this in the bottom of your glass before adding ice or any of the other ingredients\nThyme leaves are very small, so using a whole sprig will prevent them from floating around in your drink. A small sprig of the herb can also be added to the grapefruit muddle if you like. Muddle gently, though, so as not to tear too many leaves off the delicate stem.\nFor the best drink, use the freshest club soda possible. Those little bottles are very convenient because it will probably be gone before it can go flat. Typically, you can expect to get two to three drinks from one 10-ounce bottle, depending on the size of your glass.\nAdding the club soda last is a good move. The carbonated water will do most of the mixing for you. However, you can help it along by giving the drink a good stir before adding the garnish?about 10 seconds should do. You might also want to serve it with a stir stick so you can mix it up again as you drink.\nRecipe Variations\nGive this drink extra pizzazz by pouring a flavored vodka. Ketel One makes several citrus options?Citroen and Oranj?that are just as crisp and clean as the original. Either is perfect for this drink.\nClub soda is the cleanest soda water, but the drink is good with any clear sodas. Ginger ale will add a crisp sweetness, while a lemon-lime soda will further enhance the citrus. You can also look to some of the specialty sodas, like Q Drinks Grapefruit, that has light flavors and low sugar; or try a nice vodka tonic made with Fever-Tree Lemon Tonic.\nNo thyme? No problem! If you don't have this herb, consider adding another in its place. Basil would be the top choice for this drink because it's both a common thyme substitute in cooking as well as common grapefruit companion. Rosemary is another option and it's another perfect pairing for grapefruit.\nHow Strong Is a Vodka Soda?\nThis vodka soda is a very relaxing drink that's not strong compared to other cocktails. On average, it will mix up to 10 percent ABV (20 proof), so it's nearly the same as drinking a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ketel-soda-with-grapefruit-and-thyme-cocktail-recipe-4177407

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nWhen you can't find fresh cranberries, you can rehydrate dried cranberries for this drink. Simply soak them in hot water (vodka works, too) for about 20 minutes and strain off the liquid. The fruit won't be picture perfect but will work just fine for the muddle and the garnish will sink rather than float.\nYou can purchase pumpkin pie spice at most grocery stores, though it's very easy to make at home. The classic pumpkin spice mix is made of allspice, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg and you can mix up as little as 2 teaspoons.\nFresh lemon juice is highly recommended. On average, a lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces of juice, so one piece of fruit should be enough for three cocktails.\nThere are two keys to mixing up egg cocktails: ensure your egg is super fresh and shake it extra long. The first is a safety issue and a quick water test will help you out. The second is the reason for the dry shake and ensures the white becomes fully integrated with the other ingredients.\nServing this cocktail in a chilled glass makes it just a little bit better. If you don't have one pre-chilled, take the quick route: Place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're mixing, then dump them before straining. Adding cold soda water as well makes it just a little colder.\nHow Strong Is a Polished Princess?\nLike many flavored vodkas, Sobieski Vanilla is bottled at just 70 proof.

Lower the heat to a simmer and continue to cook, stirring, until the sugar dissolves.\nAdd the butternut squash and sage. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the squash is softened and easily pierced with a fork, 10 to 15 minutes.\nRemove from the heat. Lightly smash the softened squash with a potato masher or wooden spoon in the saucepan to release more flavor. Cover and steep for 3 hours.\nStrain the squash and sage from the liquid using a fine mesh strainer.\nBottle the shrub, seal, and refrigerate for 3 to 4 days before using.\nTo make a drink, pour 1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) of the butternut-sage shrub into a glass (over ice, if you like). Top with about 6 ounces (3/4 cup) of cold seltzer, ginger ale, or water, pouring more or less to taste. Stir well.\nTips\nButternut squash varies greatly in size. You'll need about half of a large squash or a whole medium or small squash to get two cups of cubes. Be sure to scoop out the seedy pulp and remove all of the skin.\nTear the leaves slightly before adding them to the pan for a more robust sage flavor.\nSwitch to raw sugar for a slightly darker sweetness.\nIf bits of squash or sage are left in the shrub, strain it a second time through a layer of cheesecloth.\nHow to Make a Butternut-Sage Shrub Cocktail\nTaste the shrub straight to get a sense of how to use it in cocktails. Vodka and light rum are the best options because they let the butternut squash and sage flavors shine with little interruption. However, tequila is an interesting alternative. You can also use a nonalcoholic rum or tequila for a tasty mocktail.\nThe simplest option is to add a shot of the liquor to the sparkling nonalcoholic drink. A nice prosecco is a good alternative to seltzers and sodas.\nAnother intriguing mix is 1 1/2 ounces each of the liquor and shrub shaken with 1 ounce of apple cider or juice. Strain it over fresh ice in an old-fashioned glass with a splash of soda.\nFrom there, have fun exploring the possibilities of this shrub.\nHow to Store\nThe finished shrub should be stored refrigerated in a tightly sealed bottle.

Before mixing up a round of shots, rinse the glasses with cold water and place them in the coldest part of the freezer. They will be frosty in less than 10 minutes.\nYour choice of liqueurs will affect the shot's color and strength. White cr?me de cacao is clear?not creamy?and has a nice cocoa flavor. Dark cr?me de cacao is similar in color to a dark rum and tends to taste more like dark chocolate. Chocolate liqueurs like Godiva are creamy brown and have more of a milk chocolate taste.\nPeppermint schnapps can have a higher alcohol content than cr?me de menthe and that also intensifies the mint flavor. Brands like Rumple Minze top off at a whopping 100 proof, while others are a gentle 30 proof.\nWhite cr?me de menthe will create a clear shot. If you want a green drink, choose green cr?me de menthe. With either, the polar bear will likely be a little sweeter than one made with schnapps.\nRecipe Variation\nAdding a clear vodka does nothing to change the flavor. You get a slightly more potent shot with that same mint-chocolate taste. When adding vodka, keep the three liquors in equal proportion: For a single shot, pour 1/3 ounce of each.\nHow Strong Is the Polar Bear?\nThe polar bear can be as strong or as gentle as you like. It all depends on the alcohol content of the liquors you pour. For instance, if you use two 30-proof liqueurs, the shot mixes up to 11 percent ABV (22 proof), so it's like drinking a glass of wine?only faster. Add vodka or pour 100-proof peppermint schnapps and it's about 17 percent ABV (34 proof). Combining 100-proof schnapps and 80-proof vodka jumps it up to 26 percent ABV (52 proof), which is almost the strength of a martini.\n51 Great Recipes for Shots and Shooters""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/polar-bear-shot-recipe-759773

This was a typical serving size for cocktails in the late 1800s. Avoid the temptation to make the absinthe cocktail ""a double."" It is a powerful one in both taste and effect, and 2 ounces should be more than enough for anyone.\nMost modern cocktails do not include water as an actual ingredient, though it\'s a common addition to absinthe. Absinthe\'s flavor is very bold?even harsh?and the water relaxes the taste to make it palatable. The dilution from shaking the drink with ice is not enough. Don\'t skip the water, but do make sure it\'s the cleanest, coldest water you can find.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many great classic absinthe cocktails to enjoy. For drinks that are similar to this recipe, try the Dorflinger with Plymouth Gin, the Obituary cocktail with gin and dry vermouth, the Chrysanthemum with brandy and dry vermouth, or the Waldorf cocktail with rye whiskey and sweet vermouth.\nIf you\'re looking for a drink that\'s a little lighter on the anise flavor, there are some great classic recipes that you\'ll want to try as well. The Corpse Reviver No. 2 is a fascinating gin cocktail with just a dash of absinthe. The Monkey Gland sweetens things up with orange juice and grenadine, along with an absinthe rinse. There is also the unforgettable Sazerac, a favorite rye whiskey drink that requires just three drops of absinthe.\nWhat is absinthe made of?\nAbsinthe, aka the green fairy, is traditionally made by distilling grain spirits with anise, wormwood, fennel, and other herbs, such as coriander, angelica root, and nutmeg, among others. \nHow Strong Is Absinthe?\nAbsinthe is bottled at a very high proof, typically between 90 proof and 148 proof, so this is in no way a weak cocktail. Using 110 proof as an example, you can expect the absinthe cocktail to have an alcohol content around 39 percent ABV (78 proof).\n\nThe ice water mellows the drink significantly, so it is actually similar in strength to the average gin martini. However, the combination of herbs that are often used to make absinthe can add to the intoxicating effects for some people (in a similar way to J?germeister). It\'s best to enjoy this one slowly and stick to one cocktail per evening.\nBartending 101: Essential Techniques, Tips, and Tricks']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/absinthe-cocktail-recipe-759567

Press gently and let dry for about 10 minutes.\nTurn the broiler on high. Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Generously sprinkle the top of each orange slice with sugar and set on the prepared baking sheet.\nBroil the orange slices for about 5 to 6 minutes, until the sugar is caramelized and the oranges slightly browned. Set aside to cool completely.\nMake the Spiked Apple Cider\nGather the ingredients.\nFill a double old-fashioned glass halfway with ice and add the rum and amaretto.\nPour the apple cider and bitters into the glass.\nTop with soda.\nGarnish with a caramelized orange and cinnamon stick. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nCaramelizing oranges will create a mess. Use foil to make cleanup a breeze when broiling; do not use parchment paper which will burn or a glass dish because it may crack or shatter under the heat. For the stovetop method, soak the pan with hot water to melt the caramel then clean as normal.\nStore the caramelized oranges in a sealed container, refrigerating for up to two days. If needed, place parchment paper between layers so they don't stick together.\nRecipe Variations\nTamarind nectar is a surprisingly good pairing for apples. Use it instead of amaretto to sweeten the cocktail.\nNearly any sparkling beverage works well in this recipe. Use sparkling wine or a sweet soda like ginger ale or cream soda. Tonic water works too and makes a great dinner drink with a drier profile, though you'll likely want to skip the bitters.\nHow Strong Is the Spiked Apple Cider?\nDespite the liquor, this spiked apple cider cocktail is similar in strength to a glass of wine. When made with 80-proof rum, its alcohol content falls in the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range. It's nice and relaxing but will be stronger with a higher proof rum and if you switch to sparkling wine.\nWhat Alcohol Is Good With Apple Cider?\nDark spirits are the best choices for any spiked apple cider. The oak notes from an aged liquor enhance the cider wonderfully, adding a nice depth of flavor to even the simplest cocktails. Aged rum and whiskey are excellent choices, and spiced rum or whiskey gives the cider some underlying warm spice notes. Another natural companion is apple brandy. Be sure it's a true apple brandy and not the sweetened liqueur variety unless you adjust the cocktail's sweetener. Popular drinks like the Chimay? prove that apple cider is also an excellent companion with tequila; for this recipe, try a reposado or a?ejo tequila.\nCan I Caramelize Oranges on the Stovetop?\nCaramelizing oranges on the stovetop is quick and easy. The sugar gets a little more caramelized than it does under the broiler, so this method is similar to br?l?ed oranges. Simply place the oranges sugar side down in a hot, dry non-stick pan and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the sugar is caramelized. The caramel leftover on the pan's surface can make subsequent orange slices appear burnt before the sugar on the orange is caramelized. For the cleanest presentation, use a large pan that will fit all of the garnishes at once or clean the pan thoroughly between batches.\nCocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spiked-apple-cider-5082966

Stir in the sugar until it is completely dissolved.\nReduce the heat and add the rosemary, basil, and orange peel. Cover and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow the syrup to cool completely, keeping the pan covered. Strain out the herbs and peel.\nCombine the syrup, orange juice, and 2 cups of water in a pitcher. Stir and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. Serve the orangeade within a few days.\nMake the Orange Shandy\nIn an ice-filled tall glass, pour the basil-rosemary orangeade until the glass is half full.\nTop with beer and garnish with an orange slice. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe best-tasting orangeade is made with freshly squeezed orange juice. You should be able to get 3 ounces of juice from an average orange. To get 4 cups, count on juicing 10 oranges.\nThere's no need to remove all of the rosemary leaves from the stem. Simply toss a couple of whole sprigs (about 4 inches long) into the syrup.\nOn the other hand, it is best to use only basil leaves as the stem can throw off the flavor. Luckily, the herb's leaves are large so it's very easy to pick them.\nUse a paring knife or sharp peeler to cut the pieces of orange peel.\nIce is a nice addition to this shandy, but it's not necessary if your beer and orangeade are cold. It's also a good idea to serve it in chilled glasses.\nRecipe Variations\nThe orangeade can be sweetened with any of a variety of simple syrups, including unflavored for a pure orange flavor. Try it with cinnamon or ginger for a hint of spice, give it a minty twist, or try another herbal combination like lavender and sage.\nAdd a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of tequila or vodka to each glass when building the drinks for an extra kick.\nHow Strong Is a Basil-Rosemary Orange Shandy?\nSince this shandy is a 50-50 mix of orangeade and beer, the final alcohol content will be half the strength of the beer you choose to pour. If you add ice, dilution will play a role as well, helping to create a very mild drink. For instance, if your beer is 5 percent ABV, the shandy will be just 2.4 percent ABV.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/basil-rosemary-orange-shandy-4571043

Fill with ice and shake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThough this cocktail has a bit of a novelty theme, it still warrants using a good vodka. For the best taste, choose a brand that you enjoy on its own or in any other vodka martini.\nKeep your martini colder longer by serving it in a chilled glass. If you don't have one pre-chilled, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix up the drink. Discard the ice before straining.\nIf the cocktail is not black enough for you, food coloring can be used to create a darker shade. For a single drink, use 2 drops each of blue and red and 1 drop of green. This should be shaken up with the cocktail to ensure it's fully mixed.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you want to play up the Halloween theme, skip the lemon twist and garnish the martini with a creepy eyeball. It's a fun project that's easy: Stuff a blueberry into a lychee fruit with red fruit preserves to give it a bloody look.\nAnother common black martini uses gin: Shake 1 1/2 ounces of your favorite gin with 1 1/2 ounces of black raspberry liqueur (or blackberry brandy) and leave out the blue curacao. This version will not be black, but more of a deep purple; the color is dependent on the raspberry liqueur alone.\nThere is yet another way to get a black martini and that would be to make a vodka martini with Blavod. It's a black vodka that can be difficult to find, though it typically makes an appearance around Halloween in some markets. As an alternative, you can use food coloring to make black vodka.\nHow Strong Is a Black Martini?\nSince it's made entirely of liquor, you should not expect the black martini to be a light cocktail. In fact, it's one of the stronger drinks you can mix up. Though it will vary slightly, the alcohol content on this recipe should be right around 30 percent ABV (60 proof).

It's the secret to great-tasting sangria because all those flavors marry, including the juices from the fruit slices, becoming one bigger, more complex flavor.\nFor the red wine, it may be best to go with medium-bodied wine, such as malbec, merlot, or Chianti (or blends that include these grapes). They're not so light as to get lost in the punch but also won't dominate it like full-bodied cabernet sauvignons.\nFresh lime juice is recommended, and there's no reason to skip it since you're already using fresh lime slices. To get the 3/4 cup (6 ounces) needed, count on juicing at least six limes. The fruits typically yield between 1/2 and 1 ounce of juice, so have a few extra on hand.\nHow Strong Is a Bloody Rum Punch?\nUnlike many sangrias, the rum outweighs the wine, so this is going to be one of the more potent punches you can mix up. In fact, it's as strong as most martini drinks with an alcohol content of 21 percent ABV (42 proof) without factoring in ice dilution.

Serve and enjoy.\nHow Is Scotch Different From Whiskey?\nScotch is a style of whiskey, and the main difference between scotch and other whiskeys is geographic. They also differ in terms of ingredients and how the word whiskey is spelled. Scotch is whisky specifically made in Scotland. It is distilled from peat-dried malted barley, which imparts its signature smoky flavor, and is either blended or single malt. Scotch also spells whisky without the ""e."" Other whiskey styles are distilled in other parts of the world from other grains, including corn and rye.\nTips\nSave your really good scotch for sipping straight and choose a budget-friendly option for your scotch sour experiments.\nBlended scotch is generally preferred over single malts for this cocktail because the milder, balanced flavor tends to work best with lemon. It really does not work well with heavily peated scotch or those with other dominant flavors.\nFresh lemon juice is essential. The bottled varieties do not have the clean taste that scotch deserves. One lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces of fresh-squeezed juice, so half a lemon should be about right.\nIf you prefer, stir this cocktail in the shaker for about 30 seconds. The ice dilution helps marry the two contrasting flavors, and it\'s still best when strained over fresh ice.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a few ways to make a scotch sour and which you choose is going to depend on the particular scotch you pour. If you find that the drink is a little too sour with one whisky, experiment with these additives:\nAdd 1 teaspoon of sugar or a dash of simple syrup.\nAdd a splash of soda water, but avoid sweetened sodas.\nTo give the sour a foam and luscious mouthfeel, shake it with 1/2 ounce of egg white. Often, this addition is best with the sweetener.\nHow Strong Is the Scotch Sour?\nThe scotch sour is a very short drink, shaking up just shy of 3 ounces. Like many cocktails of this sort, the alcohol content is about half the bottling strength of the scotch. With an 80-proof whisky, it weighs in at about 22 percent ABV (44 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/scotch-sour-recipe-761495

At around 12 ounces, you might want to split it into two glasses and share the tiki experience.\nThe Rums\nA signature of tiki cocktails is to combine various styles of rum. The zombie punch takes that to an extreme, requiring three shots to create a rather strong drink. The key here is to interpret Don the Beachcomber\'s rum picks into modern-day offerings.\nJamaican Rum: The Caribbean island is known for producing heavy, full-flavored rums and the government has some of the strictest regulations found in the rum industry. Look for brands like Appleton Estate, Hampden, J Wray and Nephew, and Rum Nation, though there is no shortage of rum coming out of Jamaica.\nGold Puerto Rican Rum:  Puerto Rico claims to be the ""Rum Capital of the World"" and some very fine rums come from the island. These rums must be aged in American oak barrels for at least a year and use continuous distillation. While there are other styles of rum produced there, this recipe specifically calls for gold rum. Look for bottles of this from Bacardi, Don Q, and Ron Castillo.\n151-Proof Demerara Rum: This overproof rum really gives the zombie punch a kick and it\'s very specific. The demerara version of overproof rum has a smokiness that gives it a nearly burnt taste, so it\'s a nice addition to such a complex drink. For this one, you don\'t have many options: Lemon Hart and Hamilton are two brands to look for. In a pinch, try another 151 rum, such as that from Cruzan.\nRecipe Variation\nDuring the time that the original zombie punch was essentially lost to the bartending community, there were many attempts to replicate the recipe. A number of those transformed the drink from a single frozen cocktail into a boozy party punch.\n\nQuite often, these recipes became an explosion of ingredients?almost as if people threw whatever juices, sweeteners, and liquors they had into a punch bowl. In some cases, it worked out, while others failed in everything except the mission to get everyone drunk. Yet, most modern zombie punch recipes cannot stand up to the well-balanced flavor of the Beachcomber\'s.\n\nIf you\'d like to taste one of the better zombie punch recreations, give this one a try: 2 cups each orange liqueur, lime juice, and orange juice; 750-ml bottle each of gold or light rum and dark rum; 2 ounces Pernod; 1/2 cup grenadine; 1 cup each lemon juice, papaya or pineapple juice, and passionfruit juice.\n\nThis punch is best when mixed up several hours in advance so the flavors have time to marry and really develop, much like a sangria. You will also want to serve it over a large cake of ice, making it nice and cold with a good amount of dilution. A bunch of pineapple slices and other fresh, seasonal fruits are the garnish of choice.\nHow Strong Is a Zombie Punch?\nWith all the rum, you might suspect that the zombie punch will turn you into a zombie. There\'s so much going on here, though that it\'s really not terribly strong. It should mix up somewhere around 16 percent ABV (32 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/zombie-punch-recipe-759868

You'll find a colorful variety to choose from and one is sure to match your party's theme.\nVanilla is one of the easiest flavored vodkas to find. One trip to the liquor store should produce at least a few options at different price ranges.\nSince both amaretto and Irish cream are bar staples, it's a good idea to invest in a premium version of these liqueurs. All of your drinks will improve if you spend just a little more for each bottle.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than dipping the rim in one of the liqueurs, try a vanilla frosting rim for an extra sweet touch.\nSome sugar cookie martini recipes use chocolate (or white chocolate) liqueur instead of amaretto. Others use butterscotch schnapps. Both make delicious drinks, but don't quite have the neutral flavor of a sugar cookie that amaretto brings.\nSwitch to vanilla-flavored rum or a whipped cream vodka if you prefer.\nIf you want a lower-proof cocktail, pour milk or cream instead of Irish cream.\nTransform this martini into a round of party shots. The recipe will easily fill two 2-ounce shot glasses or three smaller glasses.\nHow Strong Is a Sugar Cookie Martini?\nBe careful with this sweet and innocent looking martini! It packs a big punch with an alcohol content around 25 percent ABV (50 proof).

It's even yummier with a sugar-coated rim.\nTips\nCr?me de cacao comes in dark and white (clear) varieties. Both work well in any Tootsie Roll shot, though the dark version helps counteract the orange juice so the drink looks more like the candy. Other chocolate liqueurs can be used; creamier options like Godiva will change the drink's appearance, texture, and richness.\nFor the coffee liqueur, Kahlua is commonly poured in this shot, primarily because it's the most popular. There are many other options and you might find that you enjoy another brand for this and other drinks.\nHow Strong Are Tootsie Roll Shots?\nThe Tootsie Roll can be a mild shooter. When used, the orange juice does a good job of taming down the alcohol, so the coffee-chocolate liqueur shot weighs in around 11 percent ABV (22 proof). On the other hand, the chocolate vodka version doubles that, falling in the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range.\nShots & Shooter Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tootsie-roll-shot-recipes-759839

Shake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon twist. Enjoy.\nTips\nIf you like, rim the glass with sugar.\nCointreau is most often poured in the sidecar. If you\'re going to choose a different brand of triple sec, ensure it\'s top-shelf.\nSome people enjoy their sidecar with equal amounts of Cointreau and lemon juice; the pour is typically 3/4 ounce of each. The sweet-sour balance may need to be adjusted depending on the brands and styles of brandy you use.\nFresh lemon juice is essential for a sidecar. A single lemon should yield about 1 3/4 ounces, more than enough for two drinks.\nTo reduce waste, cut the lemon spiral before slicing the fruit open to juice it.\nRecipe Variations\nSome prefer to add a dash of simple syrup to take the edge off the tartness. Try a teaspoon of 2:1 demerara syrup.\nFor a cocktail that\'s just a touch sweeter, try Spain\'s brandy de Jerez.\nPour the South American brandy pisco for a pisco sidecar.\nThe sidecar has influenced many other cocktails. Some are also classics, while others are modern creations that play off the sour formula. The most popular recipes are the Boston sidecar, Chelsea sidecar (aka Delilah or white lady), and between the sheets. You can also pour vodka instead of brandy for a balalaika or add flavors. The blackberry sidecar and ?pic? sidecar (with jalape?o syrup) are two interesting cocktails to try.\nThe History of the Sidecar\nAs most cocktail origins go, there are a few stories about who mixed up the first sidecar. One common story is found in ""The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks"" (1948) by David Embury. It says the drink was developed in a Parisian bistro during World War I by a friend who rode up to a favorite bar in a motorcycle\'s sidecar. While there is speculation, it is popularly believed that the establishment was Harry\'s New York Bar.\nAnother claim attributes Frank Meier who worked at the Paris Ritz Hotel. As Gary ""Gaz"" Regan pointed out in ""The Joy of Mixology,"" this was later disputed by a man named Bertin who worked at the Ritz after Meier.\nThe next story moves to Buck\'s Club in London, the supposed home of the French 75. In his 1922 book, ""Harry\'s ABC of Mixing Cocktails,"" Harry MacElhone credits the drink to Pat MacGarry, one of the great bartenders of the day. This was backed up in Robert Vermeire\'s 1922 ""Cocktails and How to Mix Them.""\nIt is important to note that MacElhone owned Harry\'s New York Bar and that he also credits Buck\'s Club for the French 75 in his book. While he was a popular bartender of the day, he was also (apparently) honest and did not take credit for many of the drinks that are often attributed to him.\nWhich story is correct will remain a matter of debate and opinion: the sidecar is a classic sour drink and that\'s not in question. Sours were popular during the golden age of cocktails in the early 1900s. Other great sour drinks were created at the same time, including the brandy daisy, whiskey sour, and margarita.\nHow Strong is the Sidecar?\nShort drinks like the sidecar are served at such low volumes because they are heavy on the liquor and rather potent. With an 80-proof base liquor, the average sidecar weighs in around 26 percent ABV (52 proof). This is in line with similar cocktails like the martini and Manhattan.\nWhat Cognac Is Best for a Sidecar?\nChoose a cognac with a balanced flavor for a sidecar. Try Hennessy, Pierre Ferrand, Camus, H By Hine, or R?my Martin.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-sidecar-cocktail-recipe-760601

Use a spoon to move the pulp around and release more juice. This should yield about 4 cups of watermelon juice.\nTear the mint leaves into smaller pieces as you add them to a pitcher, along with the fresh lime juice and simple syrup. Stir for about 30 seconds to infuse the sweetened juice with mint.\nAdd the light rum and 4 cups of watermelon juice to the pitcher and stir well.\nTo serve, pour the watermelon mojito into ice-filled glasses, garnishing each with a lime wheel, sprig of mint, and small watermelon wedge.\nTips\nIf you have an electric juicer, use it instead of a blender to process the watermelon.\nUnless all of the pulp is removed, the watermelon will separate, so make this pitcher drink no more than a few hours ahead. Stir the mix to reincorporate before pouring.\nRich simple syrup is sweeter and made with two parts sugar and one part water. It\'s easy and inexpensive to make at home.\nIf you want to serve the mojitos without bits of mint in the glass, make the lime, syrup, and mint infusion in a separate container. Let it chill in the fridge for about an hour, then strain out the mint and add the infused juice to the pitcher.\nAlternatively, filter out the mint while pouring. Some pitchers have a strainer in the lid, and holding a wooden spoon next to the pour spout will reduce the amount of mint in the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nSkip the straining for a thicker (though equally delicious) watermelon mojito or run the watermelon puree through a strainer as many times as you like; each round will remove a bit more pulp and leave you with a cleaner watermelon juice. Even ""seedless"" watermelon may contain a few seeds, and straining it once will remove them.\nAdd a bit of sparkle by topping each glass with an ounce or two of chilled seltzer or club soda.\nMake this a nonalcoholic watermelon mojito by skipping the rum and topping each glass with ginger ale. If guests want their drink spiked, add 1 1/2 ounces of rum to the glass, fill with the mojito mix, and stir before garnishing.\nHow Strong Is a Watermelon Mojito?\nParty drinks should be a little low-key because you don\'t want your guests to get too tipsy. This watermelon mojito follows that philosophy and mixes up to about 7 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 14 proof) when served over ice. To put the drink\'s strength into perspective, it\'s similar to high-point beer but not as strong as the average wine.\nIs Light Rum the Same as White Rum?\nLight rum and white rum are used to describe the same style of rum. It\'s an unaged, clear rum with a neutral flavor and the most commonly used rum in cocktails. However, any mojito can handle an aged rum if you want to add a little depth to the drink\'s flavor. Flavored rums (especially coconut rum) can work as well, but avoid spiced rums because the spices can counteract the watermelon mojito\'s fruity taste.\nCan You Make a Mojito Without Mint?\nA mint-infused syrup can replace the fresh mint and plain simple syrup in this recipe. While mint is required for a true mojito (or any variation of the original cocktail), watermelon pairs very well with basil and parsley. Switch to either fresh herb for an interesting and delightful twist.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/frozen-watermelon-coconut-mojitos-4133975

To lighten it up, be sure to shake it very well, and much longer (30 seconds or more) than you would other cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than Irish cream use another cream liqueur, such as RumChata.\nPumpkin pie filling includes sweetener and spice, and will naturally create a slightly sweeter pumpkin martini. When using it as a substitute for the pur?e, use just 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice.\nWhile vanilla vodka is a natural choice for a pumpkin pie martini, this drink is also really interesting when made with vanilla or spiced rum. For extra spice, replace the vodka with a bold rye whiskey.\n\nHow Strong Is a Pumpkin Martini?\nThis pumpkin martini is similar in strength to other vodka martinis. The average vanilla vodka is bottled at 70 proof (though some are 80 proof), and that lowers the cocktail's alcohol content slightly, but not too much. Generally, this pumpkin martini will weigh in around 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

It will not affect the color or taste of the drink.\nIf you prefer, pick up another chocolate liqueur. There are many delicious options on the market though most are actually creamy (cr?me liqueurs are not creamy but are so sweet that the texture is similar). Godiva and Dorda are two fantastic options created by famous chocolatiers, so you know they do this flavor justice!\nRecipe Variations\nYou can skip the ice and blend this up as a spiked milkshake. It would be best to add about 3/4 cup of milk to get the creamiest mix. Dairy alternatives, especially almond milk, will work as well.\nIf you want to add yet another yummy layer, switch the plain vodka out for a dessert-flavored vodka. Whipped cream, any of the cake vodkas, and even a chocolate vodka would be fantastic. For a fruity twist, pour strawberry or raspberry vodka.\nWhy stick with vodka? Pour a coconut rum or unflavored white rum instead.\nAdd one ounce of Irish cream (e.g., Baileys) to give the drink a creamy boost.\nHow Strong Is a Death by Chocolate?\nThis may be a boozy milkshake, but it's not strong. Though the alcohol content will vary depending on which liquors you pour (and if you add a little extra), the recipe should blend up to a mild 7 percent ABV (14 proof) or so. It's like drinking a beer, but far more delicious!""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/death-by-chocolate-cocktail-759644

It's rather finicky that way, so experiment with different pairings to find your ideal Saratoga.\nTry various sweet vermouths as well.\nA well-chilled glass will also create a better tasting cocktail from beginning to end. Since cocktail glasses may not fit in a crowded freezer, you might be better off with a quick chill: Place ice cubes in the glass while you mix, then dump them before straining.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you prefer, shake this cocktail rather than stirring it. That extra dilution from the agitation can really help marry the flavors.\nServe this cocktail on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass. It's another preference often employed with the Manhattan and is especially enjoyable with large cubes or ice balls that melt slowly.\nHow Strong Is a Saratoga Cocktail?\nLike any cocktail in the martini family, this is a power-packed drink. If you make it with 80-proof brandy and whiskey (the lowest available for both spirits), its alcohol content is a hefty 27 percent ABV (54 proof). Taking that up a notch with a bourbon, it can reach 30 percent ABV (60 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTypically, silver tequila is poured into the Chimay?, but this drink is also an excellent use for reposado tequilas. The hint of barrel aging will only enhance the cider.\nUnfiltered apple cider is essential for an authentic Chimay? experience because it offers a raw taste of the fruit. It's often only found in the fall around apple harvest. Look for it in the grocer's produce section and check with your local orchards to see if they offer it. If you cannot find it, any apple cider will do.\nOne of the easiest ways to make your own apple cider is to wash, core, and slice a number of apples. Place these in a food processor and puree. Then press the puree through a cheesecloth to extract the juice. This can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week.\nCut apples yellow very quickly once exposed to oxygen and do not look the best as a garnish. To stop the oxidation process, quickly dip the slices into a little lemon juice and shake off any excess.\nRecipe Variation\nGive the Chimay? an extra kick by using hard apple cider.\nHow Strong Is a Chimay? Cocktail?\nNeither too strong nor too light, the Chimay? is a perfectly balanced cocktail in terms of its alcohol content.

For a single serving, go with one part of Pimm's per three parts of lemonade.\nLightly crush the mint in your hand to release the scent and oils, and add it to the Pimms along with the cucumber slices, orange slices, and strawberry quarters. The rule of thumb is to add 2 slices of cucumber to one of orange and strawberry, but add as much or as little as you'd like to achieve the fruity flavor of your liking.\nStir with a long-handled spoon and serve in tall glasses with ice.\nMaking the Perfect Pimm's\nHere are a few suggestions for the perfect pitcher of Pimm's:\nUse a high-quality fizzy lemonade. Lemonades that are too acidic can spoil the flavor.\nDo not replace the Pimm's with other spirits branded as Fruit Cups. They bring their own flavors to the party but not that of a classic Pimm's.\nKeep the proportions to one part of Pimm's, three parts of lemonade, as too much Pimm's can be overwhelming, and too much lemonade will water down the Pimm's flavor.\nStick to cucumber, orange, and mint if you want a classic Pimms. Strawberries are a pretty addition. Avoid using apple slices because they will turn mushy very quickly. Some Pimm's aficionados recommend using only the cucumber peel, which adds extra flavor and will stay firmer than the slices.\nUse borage if you have it in your garden. It will make a lovely alternative to mint and can be equally refreshing. \nCan I Drink Pimm's on Its Own?\nEven if most people mix it with fizzy lemonade or ginger ale, some like it on the rocks. Although not common, some enthusiasts swear by its citrus-and-spice taste, perfect with a few ice cubes.\nHow Strong Is the Classic Pimm's?\nFruity and refreshing, Pimm's and lemonade has an average ABV of 5 percent, the same amount of alcohol as some beers. The strength of a Pimm's and lemonade depends on the recipe: Some people like more Pimm's and less lemonade, and others like it the other way around. In either case, as an alcoholic beverage, even if light, it should be consumed with caution.

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nAs with all martini-style of drinks, this one deserves a top-shelf gin. Dry gins with a traditional juniper-forward profile will likely work best because some of the softer gins will get lost behind the Dubonnet.\nOrange cura?ao is commonly used in the Napleon, but you need to ensure its quality rivals that of Grand Marnier for the best tasting drink. Many of the inexpensive brands of this orange liqueur will not do the drink justice. Pay a little extra for brands like Pierre Ferrand or Senior Cura?ao of Cura?ao and you will not be disappointed.\nBlue (or green) cura?ao are not a good substitute in this cocktail. The colored versions of the orange liqueur are more of a novelty and often not of the quality that the Napoleon deserves.\nIf you do not have a pre-chilled cocktail glass available, give it a quick chill while mixing up the drink. Place a few ice cubes in the glass then discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a few renditions of the Napoleon beyond the cura?ao option that are worth exploring. Among those are recipes that cut the Grand Marnier and Dubonnet almost in third, using just 1/2 teaspoon of each. This might be a good solution for certain gins.\nAnother common variation combines 1 1/2 ounces of gin with 1/2 ounce Dubonnet and 2 dashes each of cura?ao and Fernet Branca. The last ingredient is a uniquely flavored Italian bitter digestif that can be an acquired taste but will add an intriguing twist to the mix.\nWhen you skip the orange liqueur, you have the original Dubonnet cocktail. It's another fantastic drink to showcase the ap?ritif's perfect pairing with a really nice gin.\nHow Strong Is a Napoleon Cocktail?\nAs with most martinis, the Napoleon cocktail is not a light drink. It should mix up to have an alcohol content around 33 percent ABV (66 proof), making it just slightly softer than if you were to drink an 80-proof gin straight.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/napoleon-cocktail-recipe-759746

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with apple slices. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo make the drink really interesting, look for unfiltered, fresh-pressed apple cider. It tends to have a truer flavor and the cloudy cider adds a nice mouthfeel against the butterscotch. You can typically find it in autumn at apple orchards or a grocer's produce section.\nFor the lemon juice, it's easiest to squeeze the juice of a lemon wedge directly into the shaker. No measuring required as you want just a tart accent.\nApple slices like to turn an unpleasant yellow-brown color due to oxidation. To prevent that and keep the garnish looking fresh, dip it in a little lemon juice immediately after cutting it.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can certainly replace the tequila with vodka in this recipe if you prefer. Whiskey (particularly bourbon) is a rather interesting substitution as well.\nButterscotch sauce or syrup (the kind you'd use on ice cream or caramel apples) can be used instead of the schnapps. It will retain the flavor but knock the drink's potency down a bit.\nWhile it doesn't have the depth of flavor as this cocktail, the caramel appletini offers a similar taste. It's easier simply because it requires just two ingredients, so while you have butterscotch schnapps in stock, pick up a bottle of UV Green Apple Vodka and give it a try.\nHow Strong Is a Caramel Apple Pie?\nCompared to other martini-style cocktails, the caramel apple pie is delightfully light on the alcohol.

It passed the first test?I didn\'t go blind. I don\'t know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good.""\nThe astute viewer?with easy access to the pause and rewind controls?will notice a few of the ingredients: tequila, green creme de menthe, schnapps (assumed to be peppermint), two unknown miniature bottles (one simply says ""In-Flight""), an unlabeled purple bottle, and Krusty\'s Non-Narkotik Kough Syrup for Kids.\nIn true Homer Simpson fashion, you really should be making this drink out of the droppings left in your liquor cabinet.\nTip\nYou can order a Flaming Moe at Moe\'s Tavern inside the Universal Studios Florida theme park. However, you will actually get an orange soda-like drink served over dry ice for a smoky, bubbling effect. Fun, but no booze...sorry, it\'s kid-friendly!\nCan You Flame Cough Syrup?\nLet\'s just remember that ""The Simpsons"" is a fictional show and it is a cartoon. As any fan knows, Krusty\'s products were not always the safest either.\nCough syrups in the real world do not have enough alcohol to catch on fire. NyQuil Liquid has just 10 percent alcohol and that\'s one of the strongest available. If you have ever made a flaming drink, then you know that a 151-proof rum is typically used to top it off. That is 75.5 percent alcohol by volume and a big difference from the likes of NyQuil.\nHow Strong Is a Flaming Moe?\nYou can certainly try to drink a Flaming Moe in one shot, but it\'s a very tall drink, mixing up to about 5 ounces. Plus, with all that liquor, it\'s very strong with an alcohol content around 27 percent ABV (54 proof).

Shake well to immerse the herbs. Let infuse for 48 hours, shaking once a day.\nBring the water to a boil in a small or medium saucepan. Add the sugar and stir until completely dissolved, then reduce to a simmer. After 5 minutes, remove the simple syrup from the heat and let cool completely. If making ahead, refrigerate in a sealed container until ready to blend the liqueur.\nAfter 2 days, add the cooled simple syrup to the mint-infused liquor. Shake and infuse for another 24 hours.\nStrain out the mint using a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Discard the mint and strain one or two more times to remove extra sediment.\nFunnel the cr?me de menthe into a 750-milliliter bottle or several smaller bottles.\nTo color the liqueur, add 3 to 5 drops of green food coloring and shake well to incorporate.\nHow to Store Homemade Cr?me de Menthe\nThe vodka acts as a preservative, so your homemade cr?me de menthe will last up to a year. Keep the bottle under a tight seal to avoid oxidation and store it in a cool, dark place alongside other liqueurs. If you notice crystallization, it's best to make a new batch.\nHow to Serve Homemade Cr?me de Menthe\nYou can drink cr?me de menthe straight; it's a cooling dessert drink at room temperature or when served in a chilled cordial glass. The homemade liqueur is an excellent ingredient in any cr?me de menthe cocktail. If you choose to keep the natural color, it will not create green drinks and slightly alter the color of recipes that typically use white cr?me de menthe. As a homemade recipe that doesn't have the precision of a laboratory, the specific gravity likely differs from commercial versions. It may not work as well in layered drinks (try it to see what happens, though).\nThis minty liqueur is also delicious poured over vanilla ice cream for an easy yet party-worthy dessert.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than fresh mint, skip the infusion and add one teaspoon of peppermint extract to the simple syrup, let it cool and mix it with the vodka. This version is ready as soon as the syrup cools and comes out with a transparent color (one that you can also make green with food coloring). Add 1/8 teaspoon at a time to the finished liqueur, shake, test, and add more if desired.\nMake a sugar-free cr?me de menthe using a keto simple syrup with an allulose-based sugar alternative.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Cr?me de Menthe?\nCr?me de menthe has a relatively low amount of alcohol compared to other distilled spirits. It's typically 25 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 50 proof), and this homemade liqueur falls in the same range. Adding more syrup will create a lighter liqueur, and using high-proof vodka will make it stronger.\nAre cr?me de menthe and peppermint schnapps the same?\nWhile both are mint liqueurs, cr?me de menthe tends to be sweeter and have a less intense mint flavor than peppermint schnapps. Rarely green, the schnapps can also be much more potent, with some bottles reaching 100 proof, which exaggerates the taste. When using the two as substitutes for one another, you may have to adjust the mint liqueur and any other sweeteners in the recipe to create a well-balanced drink.\nUsing Herbs and Spices in Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-creme-de-menthe-recipe-5214345

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe average lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces, so you'll need about 1 1/2 lemons for the lemonade (use the other half to cut the garnish). To maximize juice yield, ensure the fruit is at room temperature and roll it under your palm on the countertop before cutting the fruit.\nA rich (2:1) simple syrup will create a slightly sweeter lemonade, though a shaken 1:1 bar simple syrup doesn't require heat and is an excellent shortcut.\nTo sweeten iced tea, stir in sugar while the water is still hot or add honey or agave nectar to taste.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch from vodka to rum, tequila, or whiskey.

Tea-infused vodka enhances that flavor, citrus vodka complements the lemonade, and coconut vodka (or rum) adds an interesting spin.\nPour a fruity iced tea such as raspberry or watermelon, or try something like lemon-ginger.\nLikewise, add flavor with the lemonade. Watermelon lemonade is a delicious choice, or you can give the drink a floral twist with lavender lemonade.\nHow Strong Is a Spiked Arnold Palmer?\nPouring more tea and lemonade will create a lighter drink. Generally, though, the spiked Arnold Palmer is pretty casual and similar to drinking a glass of wine. At it's strongest (with a 2-ounce pour of each mixer), it weighs in at about 12 percent ABV (24 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spiked-arnold-palmer-recipe-5075194

Squeeze the lemon and orange wedges into the pitcher.\nAdd the wine and stir to dissolve the sugar. Add the brandy and stir.\nCover the pitcher and refrigerate for 8 hours or up to overnight to marry the fruit and wine flavors.\nAdd the ginger ale or club soda just before serving. Garnish with freshly cut lemon or orange wheels, if desired.\nTips\nYou can make sangria as dry or as sweet as you like. Adjust the sweetness by your choice of wine, adding or subtracting sugar, and your choice of fruit. For drier sangria, use club soda instead of ginger ale.\nSangria can be served over ice, if you prefer. On hot days, it keeps the drink well-chilled and a little dilution creates a slightly more refreshing drink.\nRecipe Variations\nYou might opt for a shot or two of gin or rum instead of the brandy. Some people prefer to skip the liquor completely.\nTo kick up the citrus flavors of this sangria, add another sliced orange and lemon to the mix. You can also add fresh limes or switch to a lemon-lime soda.\nYou can add almost any fruit you like. Sliced strawberries along with diced peaches and a handful of fresh blueberries practically shout summer. Raspberries with a few slices of kiwi make a nice combination for the red wine as well.\nHow Strong Is Red Wine Sangria?\nSangrias are a great way to add fresh flavor to wine without adding to its strength. Even with the brandy, all of the nonalcoholic ingredients balance it out to produce a drink that's about the same strength as a glass of light white wine. On average, this red wine sangria should mix up to 7 to 8 percent alcohol by volume (ABV).\nWhich Wine Is Better for Sangria?\nSince sangria is a Spanish drink, a Spanish Rioja, such as tempranillo or garnacha or even a blend, makes a good choice as the base for red wine sangria. Shiraz or zinfandel are also nice options. In fact, you can choose almost any bottle of red wine you like, but it's best to start with a drier one. A sauvignon blanc pairs well with tropical fruits if you decide to use white wine.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-sangria-recipe-3511080

It's not entirely clear which types of berries were used to flavor it, but it was likely a blend.\nAs an alternative, you can go with Skyy's blueberry, raspberry, or wild strawberry vodkas. A number of other vodka brands produce a blended berry option as well?most include blueberry and strawberry, sometimes raspberry. Look for bottles like Belvedere Wild Berry, New Amsterdam Red Berry, and Pinnacle Berry.\nYou can certainly use dark cr?me de cacao if you have it in stock without changing the flavor. The white (clear) variety of the liqueur is preferred because the drink will then have a pretty pink color.\nBe careful about pouring high-proof peppermint schnapps because it will have a stronger flavor and may overpower the cocktail. If you choose one, consider using less?1/2 ounce or so?to keep the drink in balance.\nRecipe Variations\nServe this cocktail on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass if you prefer.\nIf you skip the candy rim, an appropriate garnish for the candy cane is, of course, a candy cane! Hook one on the rim, letting the long end rest in the drink or simply place a peppermint candy stick in the cocktail. Either way, it doubles as a stir stick!\nHow Strong Is a Candy Cane Cocktail?\nDespite having three distilled spirits, the candy cane is a surprisingly light cocktail.

Let the excess drip off while the glass is still upside down.\nQuickly dip the wet edge of the glass in a dish of the colored sugar. Ensure you get a nice, even coat all the way around. Tap off any excess sugar. Repeat with 2 more shot glasses, rolling one each in either the green, gold or purple sugars.\nIn a cocktail shaker, pour the vodka, cream liqueur, and cinnamon schnapps. Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into the prepared shot glasses.\nTop with whipped cream and a sprinkle of ground nutmeg. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIt's easy to make colored sugar at home if you can't find the three colors at the store. Simply add four to five drops of food coloring to about 1/8 cup of white sugar. Stir with a fork until the sugar becomes one color, about 1 to 2 minutes. Lay the sugar out in a thin pile on waxed paper to dry overnight.\nWhen using liquid food coloring, you will have to break up the resulting sugar cake into fine crystals again. A muddler makes quick work of that. Gel food coloring doesn't cake up as much.\nYou'll get the most vibrant colors if you can avoid mixing food coloring; use purple gel rather than blue and red liquid food coloring.\nFill each shot glass just below the sugar line. If the liquid touches homemade colored sugar, the color will run into the drink and look quite messy. This generally isn't a problem if the whipped cream touches the sugar.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, any vodka with a sweet flavor can be used as a substitute for the cake vodka. Whipped cream vodkas are fun and a standard vanilla-flavored vodka is a nice choice as well. You can also pour lemon vodka (or limoncello) to replicate that lemon zest found in many King Cake recipes.\nAmaretto is a good substitute for cinnamon schnapps. The flavor will change, of course, but it is a nice option if you don't have the schnapps in your bar.\nAlternatively, pour a cinnamon-flavored whiskey, such as Fireball or Jim Beam Fire, instead of cinnamon schnapps.\nIf you really want to get in the King Cake spirit, drop a rum-soaked raisin in the bottom of each glass. Other trinkets that are typically hidden in King Cake?including nuts and coins?can be a choking hazard in a drink, but the raisin is a nice, relatively safe surprise.\nHow Strong Is the King Cake Shot?\nThe King Cake shots are deceptively delicious because their sweet taste masks the high alcohol content. Though it will vary depending on which brands you pour for the three liquors, on average this shot weighs in around 27 percent ABV (54 proof).

The recipe above is one of the most popular and oldest recipes. If you\'re in the mood for a slightly different yellow bird, try one of these:\nThe blended yellow bird is a popular frozen cocktail on cruise ships. It is made by blending 1 ounce each of light rum and pineapple juice, 1/4 ounce each of Galliano and cr?me de banane liqueurs, and 2 ounces of orange juice. It\'s served over ice in a hurricane glass. You can also skip the blender and shake the ingredients.\nMany yellow bird recipes come from Caribbean vacation hot spots, and one popular version includes coffee liqueur. Shake 1 1/2 ounces light rum, 3/4 ounce cr?me de banane, 1/2 ounce each of Tia Maria (coffee liqueur), and pineapple juice, and 2 1/2 ounces orange juice. Strain it over fresh ice.\nAnother popular option skips the orange juice in the Galliano recipe.\nFor a simple yellow bird, top a shot each of rum and banana liqueur with orange juice.\nSometimes, vodka is added to the mix. These versions often skip the juice, opting for sour mix with 151-proof rum instead.\nHow Strong Is a Yellow Bird?\nWhen it comes to alcohol content, the yellow bird falls in line with many similar tropical cocktails. They tend to contain a nice amount of liquor offset by an abundance of fruit. This makes the drinks deceptive because the alcohol is masked by all the flavor, so it\'s very easy to have one too many (not the best idea on a sunny beach). Be sure to drink plenty of water with the yellow bird as it weighs in around 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

Shake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a dusting of nutmeg. Serve and enjoy.\nIs Kahl?a the Same as Cr?me de Cacao?\nAlthough dark cr?me de cacao might look similar in appearance to Kahl?a, the former, as its name entails, is made from cacao beans and is a chocolate-flavored liqueur. The latter is a coffee-flavored liqueur.\n\nSome dessert recipes allow swapping one for the other, but in the cocktail realm, a true brandy Alexander needs the chocolaty flavor to succeed.\nTips\nMost brandies will do a great job in the brandy Alexander, and there's no need to spend a fortune on this drink. Instead, choose a decent, moderately priced brandy. Don't overlook small distilleries as they make some of the best brandies on the market.\nCr?me de cacao is not a creamy liquor, has a subtle cocoa flavor, and is rather sweet. Bols, Marie Brizard, and Tempus Fugit all make a great cr?me de cacao, and you will find that they're surprisingly affordable.\nChoose your preferred heaviness when it comes to the cream. Heavy cream and half-and-half are the top recommendations. Milk can be too light, but if you want to use it, go with 2 percent or whole milk.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Alexander was originally a gin cocktail. To make it, simply replace the brandy with gin. It's interesting to compare the two: Gin's botanical flavor adds an interesting depth to the drink. However, there's a reason the brandy version has outlasted the original, so most people will find it preferable.\nFor dairy intolerances or allergies, or for guests who have a dairy-free approach to their diets, a dairy cream alternative can work in this cocktail. The flavor profile will not be the same, but it's certainly worth trying with almond, soy, rice, or other non-dairy beverages. Even vegan unsweetened coffee creamers could work as long as they don't have a strong flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Brandy Alexander?\nThe brandy Alexander may look and taste innocent, and in comparison to other brandy cocktails like the metropolitan, it is. With an 80-proof brandy and the average cr?me de cacao, this drink's alcohol content is around 19 percent ABV (38 proof). However, it is not a light cocktail, so don't let its sweet taste trick you into drinking more than you intend to.\n17 Dessert Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-alexander-cocktail-recipe-759278

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAll of the Long Island drinks are easy to remember. Just keep in mind that each requires five white spirits. Then, you add a sour, and that one ingredient that defines the location indicated in the name. For the Long Beach version, it\'s helpful to associate the place and the juice with ""healthy."" It\'s a simple memory trick that can help you keep it straight with the others.\nLet\'s be honest: Save your good booze for another drink. There\'s so much going on in the Long Beach tea that there\'s really no need to pour your best spirits into it unless you want to. Bartenders typically make these ""teas"" with liquor from the well, and it\'s a perfect way for you to save money in your home bar as well.\nThe sour mix is one of those mixers that you can either buy or DIY. Making it yourself will save money and takes maybe 20 minutes of your time. A single batch of the citrus-flavored syrup can handle more than a few rounds of Long Beach teas and leave you with more to store for other drinks.\nWith most of these ""tea"" recipes, the last ingredient poured fills the glass. You might find yourself adding more cranberry juice, and that will just sweeten the drink and dilute the alcohol a bit more. Yet, if you\'re using a really big glass, there\'s no need to fill it.\nMany tall glasses used in kitchens hold far more than the standard highball or Collins glasses in bars. Just because you can fill it to the rim doesn\'t mean you have to. Think of the drink\'s flavor balance over its volume, and you\'ll enjoy your homemade cocktails just a little more.\nThe Long Beach tea does not have to be a really strong drink. The key to keeping it light so you don\'t fall down drunk after the first round is to measure the liquor. Over-pouring is the biggest problem with these cocktails. It not only ramps up the amount of alcohol you\'re drinking, but it can also ""burn"" the drink\'s flavor. They really do taste better if you try to keep the liquor in check. \nRecipe Variation\nReplace the lemon slice garnish with a slice of orange or some berries, such as a blackberry and raspberry mixture.\nLong Beach Iced Tea vs. Long Island Iced Tea\nVery simply, the Long Beach uses cranberry as the mix, while the Long Island uses cola.\nHow Strong Is the Long Beach Tea?\nA lot of liquor goes into this drink, but you will notice that it only adds up to 2 1/2 ounces in a 5 1/2-ounce drink. Sure that\'s the majority of the drink. Yet, when we do the math, we find that the Long Beach tea is not the strongest drink in the bar.\n\nWhen made with 80-proof brands of the first four liquors and a 60-proof triple sec, the Long Beach tea is a surprisingly mild 17 percent ABV (36 proof). To put this into perspective, the strongest wines are about 14 percent ABV and the martini is a hefty 31 percent ABV. This drink is just a little stronger than popular highballs like the Moscow mule.\nHawaiian Iced Tea']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/long-island-ice-tea-with-cranberry-761100

The average lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounce, so one lemon be plenty and you may even get enough for two drinks out of a larger lemon.\nIf you are careful and want to conserve your lemon, cut the twist first then cut the lemon in half to get the juice needed.\nIf you do not have maple syrup on hand, a rich simple syrup or dark agave nectar will do fine, though they are not quite the same as a truly rich maple here.\nThe average large egg has an egg white of about 1 ounce. Since this recipe calls for 1/2 ounce, you will either want to split the egg white in half or make two drinks at one time. There is a point where this cocktail can have too much egg, so it is important to be aware of that.\nHow Strong Is the Ginger Sour?\nThis Ginger Sour recipe is surprisingly light compared to many other vodka martinis. That is because Skyy Ginger is a 70 proof vodka and it is outweighed by the total volume of everything else in the drink. Enjoy the smooth sipping of this drink because it comes in at right around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).\nMake Your Own Ginger Vodka\nGinger is a great flavor for distilled spirits and it is very easy to make your own ginger-infused vodka. This infusion can take up to two full weeks to reach the optimal flavor, so it is best to plan ahead.\n1/2 cup fresh ginger cut into 1/8-inch thick dials*\n1 750ml bottle vodka\n*Some ginger infusion recipes will call for grated or diced ginger.

Of course, if you are adventurous, you can always make your own limoncello.\nWhen it comes to the tea, you have even more options. This drink would be best with a quality neutral-flavored tea; black tea is a favorite for iced tea.\nA quick way to get more flavor out of your teas is to use the hot brewing method, which requires less than 5 minutes to steep (depending on the type of tea you choose). Once the tea is at its full flavor, chill it in the refrigerator until it is time to mix up a drink.\nIf you need to chill the tea quickly, simply place it in the freezer for about 5 to 10 minutes. Even this can be sped up by splitting the tea into smaller portions (just enough to make the first round of drinks).\nHow Strong Is the Bourbon Tea?\nThere are many variables in the bourbon tea that will determine how strong the finished drink is.

Enjoy.\nTips\nThe standard bottle of liquor is 750ml (aka a ""fifth"") and that just happens to be the 3 cups needed for the recipe. There\'s no measuring required for the booze; simply pour a full bottle of the two spirits.\nTraditionally, the individual serving size for punch is 4 ounces. If you\'ll be pouring taller drinks for your guests, you will get fewer than 25 drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you\'d like to make a single cocktail, just shake 1 ounce of each ingredient and strain it into an old-fashioned glass (it also makes a lovely ""martini"" in a cocktail glass). There\'s no need for ice unless you\'d like to add it.\nThere\'s absolutely no reason why you can\'t use a cranberry-pomegranate juice blend instead of the individual juices. The flavor may be slightly different depending on how much of each juice is in the blend, but it will still be a great tasting punch and most people won\'t notice the difference.\nPut a little more holiday flair into this drink by garnishing each punch glass with a cinnamon stick. The flavor will slowly infuse into the drinks (a great pairing for the juices) and it doubles as a stir stick.\nHow Strong Is Mrs. Claus\' Wildside Punch?\nWithout taking into account any dilution from the ice, this punch is surprisingly mild. All that juice brings the alcohol content down to a pleasant 14 percent ABV (28 proof).

Pour the coffee liqueur over the ice.\nSlowly pour the vodka over the ice, either so it hits an ice cube or over the back of a bar spoon.\nSlowly add the soda, again breaking the pour with ice or a spoon.\nServe with a straw and enjoy.\nTip\nDon't worry too much if the coffee liqueur and vodka do not make a clean layer. The two liquors tend to meld together. You will notice that the first sips through the straw are mostly coffee, the next sips have more vodka, and then you'll start to get the soda.\nThe type of soda is open to interpretation. Club soda is the most common, though you can pour sparkling or mineral water. Some mind eraser fans prefer a lemon-lime soda, while others enjoy ginger ale. Both of these will create a slightly sweeter drink.\nRecipe Variations\nShake the vodka and coffee liqueur with ice, then strain into the ice-filled glass.\nIt's popular to enjoy the mind eraser as a party shooter. The challenge is to finish it off in one attempt, and drinking it quickly through a straw creates quite the head rush?similar to eating ice cream too fast. It's best to cut the drink in half, so you're drinking just 3 ounces rather than a full 6-ounce drink.\nThe brain eraser is a shot inspired by this recipe. It's built and drunk in the same way, though the Kahl?a is often split with an equal part of amaretto. Some brain eraser shots are made with equal parts of vodka, Goldschl?ger, and Kahl?a, layered in that order in a shot glass.\nHow Strong Is the Mind Eraser?\nThe mind eraser is not the mildest drink you can make. On average, its alcohol content falls right around 16 percent ABV (32 proof). While that's a little stronger than the average glass of wine, it does have a reputation fitting of its name. That's primarily due to its delicious taste that lures you back for another, and the fact that some people drink it so quickly.\n15 Delicious Coffee Liquor Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mind-eraser-vodka-shot-761115

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon peel.\nTips\nServing this martini in a chilled cocktail glass will keep the drink colder. For a quick chill, place a few ice cubes in the glass while mixing up the drink and discard them before straining.\nSome bottled pomegranate juices are very sweet, while others are almost pure fruit juice with little or no added sweetener. Taste the juice on its own so you have an idea for how much lemon juice to add.\nJuicing a fresh pomegranate is incredibly simple: Place the arils (or seeds) in a baggie and crush them to release the juice, then strain out the seeds.\nRecipe Variations\nIf your taste leans toward sweeter cocktails, add 1/4 to 1/2 ounce of simple syrup to the shaker.\nSwitch from a triple sec like Cointreau to a brandy-based orange liqueur (e.g., Grand Marnier) for a darker hint of orange.\nFlavored vodkas are a great option, and citrus vodka is a nice choice. Give the pomegranate martini a seasonal spice with either cinnamon or ginger vodka (both are simple homemade infusions).\nPeach schnapps is a fun addition to this cocktail; try adding 1/2 ounce of the sweet liqueur.\nUse the Pama martini recipe when switching from juice to pomegranate liqueur.\nFor a virgin pomegranate martini, shake 2 ounces each of pomegranate juice and orange or cranberry juice with a squeeze of lemon. It's fantastic with a splash of club soda.\nAround the holidays, rim the glass with a mixture of sugar and ground cinnamon: Mix equal parts of the two ingredients until it becomes an even, light brown color. Wet the glass rim with a lemon wedge, then roll it in a small dish of cinnamon sugar.\nHow Strong Is a Pomegranate Martini?\nWhile a martini made with pomegranate juice is slightly lighter than one that uses pomegranate liqueur, the difference is not significant. This pomegranate martini is still pretty potent, with an average alcohol content of 20 percent ABV (40 proof). To put that into perspective, drinking two of these martinis is like taking a straight shot of vodka.\nDo Pomegranate Seeds Make a Good Garnish?\nWhen in season, add a few pomegranate arils as a garnish if you like. Whether fresh or dried, pomegranate arils are not likely to float unless added to carbonated drinks (though some may surprise you).

There are many great-tasting and budget-friendly vodkas on the market today. Explore these options and find the best ""well"" vodka for your bar to use in drinks like this.\nIf you want the best screwdriver possible, use fresh-squeezed orange juice. It takes just a few minutes to get enough fresh juice for the drink. If you\'re going to use a store-bought juice, look for the most natural juice available.\nRecipe Variations\nWhile the drink requires just two elements, there are options that can ramp up your average screwdriver.\nFlavored vodka is the easiest way to add a spark of flavor. Citrus vodkas are an obvious option, though something with a little more contrast will add depth. Try one of the berry vodkas for starters. Either cucumber or vanilla vodkas are amazing here as well. Experiment with your own infusions; rosemary-strawberry vodka is a fun base for a screwdriver.\nOrange juice has a natural acidity that can be combated with a little sweetener. To keep the flavor profile untouched, add simple syrup. If you want to bring in another flavor along with sweetness, take a hint from the tequila sunrise and add grenadine or similar flavored syrup, such as strawberry or raspberry-lavender. Just a small dollop of syrup will make a world of difference.\nLighten up your screwdriver by topping it off with soda. Club soda and ginger ale are two perfect options, though you may also want to consider something a bit more fun like Dry Cucumber Soda or Q Ginger Ale. Or take inspiration from drinks like the mimosa and add sparkling wine.\nBefore pouring your screwdriver, muddle a few pieces of fresh fruit in your glass. Berries add a nice contrast, and kiwifruit are an easy and fun addition. Lemon, lime, peach, and almost any fruit you can find will add a nice touch to this simple drink.\nInstead of vodka, pour tequila and orange juice.\nHow Strong Is a Screwdriver?\nThe strength of your screwdriver will ultimately depend on how much orange juice you pour, but it is generally a low-proof cocktail. When made according to the recipe with 80-proof vodka, it should have an alcohol content of around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). It\'s like drinking a glass of light white wine, only fruitier.\n20 Cheap and Easy Mixed Drinks to Make at Home']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/popular-screwdriver-variations-759820

Stir well.\nTips\nThe Liquor. You can certainly make the Hawaiian Iced Tea as top-shelf as you like by choosing some very good spirits to pour into it. Yet, most bartenders will opt for the liquor bottles in the bar's well and this is perfectly fine. It's not as if you're going to notice the subtle nuances of that high-end tequila or gin in this mixed drink anyway, so feel free to save a bit of money. There are some very nice brands within each of these spirit categories that are affordable for the majority of drinkers.\nRemember that if you're going to go cheap on your booze, choose wisely.\nThe Sour Mix. Yes, you can buy sour mix (aka bar mix or sweet and sour) at the liquor store, but there's really no reason to waste your money. Sour mix is, quite simply, citrus-flavored simple syrup and if you can make this cocktail, you will have no problem making this easy mixer at home. It will require, at most, 20 minutes of your time. Besides, any true frugal drinker will want to save cash wherever they can, right? Learning how to make these simple drink sweeteners will cut your bar budget significantly. The average cup of syrup is less than 20 cents with flavoring ingredients. This lasts at least two weeks of regular usage. How's that for frugal?\nHow Strong Is the Hawaiian Iced Tea?\nLike the other variations of the Long Island, the Hawaiian Iced Tea is actually quite mild as long as you do not pour too much liquor. The 1/2-ounce each of the spirits is perfect for achieving a drinkable, enjoyable beverage and it keeps the total pour of liquor at just 2 1/2 ounces. If you were to pour 80-proof base spirits and a 60-proof triple sec into this drink, it would have an alcohol content of around 16% ABV (32 proof). While it's a bit stronger than the average single-spirit tall drink, it's not out of line with the 'tea' cocktail family it belongs to.

It's light in comparison to other martinis because the amount of apple cider almost equals the amount of liquor. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how this one stacks up.\n\nAssuming you mix an 80-proof vodka with a 70-proof vanilla liqueur, the apple pie martini will be about 19 percent ABV (38 proof). To put this into perspective, a drink like the chocolate martini often weighs in at 26 percent ABV.\nTips\nThe vanilla liqueur: There are a number of premium vanilla liqueurs that are a fit for this apple martini. For this specific recipe, a little extra spice is actually a very good thing.\nTuaca: This liqueur is a blend of vanilla and citrus, which plays nicely in this cocktail. If using it, skip the lime juice.\nGalliano L'Autentico: An herbal liqueur with vanilla in the foreground, backed by a little anise and other herbs and spices. It makes a very flavorful apple pie martini.\nLicor 43: Another blended herbal liqueur with a vanilla focus, it is one of the preferred substitutions in cocktails that once called for Navan.\nBols Vanilla: Possibly the closest to Navan, the Bols version of vanilla liqueur is very vanilla. It is sweet, has delicate citrus notes, and is fantastic in many cocktails.\nThe vodka. As with most vodka martinis, you'll want to go top-shelf in the apple pie martini. Choose from smooth vodkas like Belvedere, Grey Goose, or one of the many luxury vodkas that are on the market. This is also a fabulous opportunity to use a craft vodka from one of America's small distilleries. If you like, switch to a vanilla vodka to enhance that flavor.\nRecipe Variation\nJust like other apple martini recipes, you can take another approach to the apple pie martini. This variation retains all of the flavors, it simply goes about it in a different way. What is nice about this version is that it eliminates the need to seek out a vanilla liqueur. Instead, the vanilla is taken over by a flavored vodka, the cinnamon comes from an easy-to-find schnapps, and we keep the cider in the forefront.\n1 1/2 ounces vanilla vodka\n1 ounce cinnamon schnapps\n2 ounces apple cider\nDash of fresh lime juice\nButternut Squash and Sage Shrub Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/apple-pie-martini-recipe-760994

Factors like alcohol content (proof) and the amount of sugar determine how well they float on top of one another. If you switch brands, you might need to experiment with the order of pour to see what works with a particular combination.\nSome banana liqueurs will work the same as (or better than) Giffard's (50 proof); try DeKuyper Cr?me de Banana (30 proof) or Bols Banana (34 proof). 99 Bananas really is 99 proof?too strong for the bottom layer, it may work on top.\nDr. McGillicuddy Cherry (60 proof) is a little stronger than many cherry liqueurs: Cherry Heering is 43.6 proof and Bols Cherry is 48 proof.

Even though the flavor is pomegranate, many people mistake it for cherry, so the taste will be similar.\nA possible UV Blue (60 proof) substitute is blue cura?ao. The flavor will switch from raspberry to orange, and it's typically similar in proof (though with more sugar). The blue cura?ao will likely be a good top layer, depending on what you pour in the middle.\nTips:\nPouring very slowly is key with layered drinks, and the bar spoon helps slow down the flow.\nIt can also help to use a chilled shot glass.\nYou will notice these liquors blend where the colors meet. They produce more of a gradient than the three perfectly even layers seen in shots like Captain America.\nRecipe Variations:\nLayered Superman shots vary greatly. If you'd like something a little different, try one of these combinations:\nOne popular version doesn't include a red layer: Irish cream is on the bottom, blue cura?ao's in the middle, and a banana liqueur is poured on top.\nAnother tasty version starts off with grenadine, then blue cura?ao and banana liqueur (these may layer), finishing it up with white or gold rum.\nA unique option requires a harder to find ingredient. This one begins with pours of UV Blue Vodka and blue cura?ao, then finishes it off with red absinthe (look for bottles from Corsair Distillery, Exitus, and Rodnik's).\nHow Strong Is the Superman Shot?\nThree liquors and no dilution from ice means your Superman shot will be strong.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you don\'t have a muddler, smash the ingredients with the back of a spoon or the handle of a wooden spoon.\nIn the original recipe, 1 teaspoon of sugar was dissolved in 2 teaspoons of water, creating an in-the-glass simple syrup. If bartenders of the day used a liquid sweetener, it most likely would have been gomme syrup. Any of these options will work.\nRinse fresh mint before using it; it\'s easier to do this while it\'s still on the stem.\nTo ensure a mint-free drink, fine-strain the cocktail: Pour through your shaker\'s regular strainer into a fine-mesh strainer held over the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nThough the recipe calls for bourbon, other styles of whiskey will work just fine in the whiskey smash. If you prefer a robust rye or a smooth Canadian, feel free to pour one of those instead. It\'s all a matter of personal preference. The drink will take on a different character with each whiskey you pour.\nIn a pinch, orange would be a preferred choice over lime if those are the only citrus options you have. In that case, the drink becomes more of a minty old-fashioned.\nWhat Is a Smash Cocktail?\n""Smash"" cocktails use a muddler to press the juices and oils out of fresh ingredients and mix the flavors together before adding the liquor. While any muddled cocktail qualifies, the classic smash drinks feature mint. Along with this whiskey smash, the brandy smash and gin smash (made with genever) were equally popular in the 1800s. Those two typically skip the lemon and use mint alone. Other spirits work in the smash recipes as well: Try it with rum for a mojito-like drink or vodka.\nWhat\'s the Best Mint for Cocktails?\nThomas specifies spearmint in his whiskey smash recipe. It is the most common variety of mint available and often the type that\'s simply labeled ""mint."" Any mint will work, and some of the newer hybrids like pineapple and chocolate mints can make a very interesting smash as well. The 1887 recipe calls for ""3 to 4 young sprigs of mint,"" and that can be a lot for such a short drink. Yet, mint does not come in standard sizes, so adjust the quantity as you see fit. Dried mint is OK to use as well, and some drinkers say they prefer its flavor over the fresh herb. Experiment and see what you think. \nHow Strong Is the Whiskey Smash?\nThere is not much added to the whiskey in this drink, so it doesn\'t dip far below the whiskey\'s bottling strength. If your whiskey is 80 proof, then the average whiskey smash would be around 23 percent ABV (46 proof).\nWhiskey Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiskey-smash-cocktail-761400

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.\nTips\nThis cocktail is not chilled. If you don't want to add ice but want to give it a gentle frost, place your snifter (or other glass) in the freezer about 30 minutes before mixing the drink. For a quicker chill, place a few ice cubes in the glass for a few minutes then dump them out.\nChocolate liqueur is very common; white chocolate liqueur is not (though it is getting better). White cr?me de cacao is another option, though it's not creamy.\nMany Irish cream producers offer a white chocolate version that will also work in this cocktail. This is primarily true of small brands straight from Ireland, so you may have to do some digging to find one.\nRecipe Variation\nThe white Christmas also looks great in a cocktail glass, in which case this recipe could easily serve two. You might want to go up to 2 ounces of Southern Comfort and 1 ounce of chocolate liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a White Christmas Cocktail?\nWhiskey comes in a variety of strengths, so your cocktail's alcohol content will depend a lot on which you choose. If you were to pour 80-proof whiskey, the drink would be just 9 percent ABV (18 proof), similar to a glass of wine. Even with 100-proof whiskey, the volume of eggnog used here will create a mild drink.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/white-christmas-cocktail-recipe-a-twist-on-eggnog-761519

Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with grated nutmeg on top. Serve immediately.\nRecipe Tip\nThis cocktail is the perfect candidate for your favorite go-to vodka. There\'s no need use a top-shelf vodka because of the cream. Instead, find a great-tasting vodka that fits your budget and keep it in your bar\'s stock for drinks like this.\nThe amaretto is equally important for this cocktail because it has the same pour as the vodka. Consider using a homemade amaretto, which is quite easy and fun to make.\nThe nutmeg really should not be skipped. For some cocktails, you can forget about the garnish, but for this one, the nutmeg makes a big impact on the flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are choices to make regarding the ingredients of this drink if you need lower fat content, a dairy-free alternative, or are keener on the flavor of other spirits. Here\'s what you can do:\nHeavy cream is a very rich option, and it is a nice choice for making the most luscious cocktails. However, it does come with high-fat content, and if this is a concern for your diet, you may think about switching to half-and-half or light cream. Plant-based alternatives to dairy, like almond milk, cashew milk, or oat milk, are good options as well because they\'re lighter but still have some body.\nA cream liqueur, such as Irish cream or RumChata, would make a nice alternative, too. This will boost the drink\'s strength, but they\'re low proof, so the difference is minimal.\nIf you prefer the flavor and feeling of whiskey, follow the godfather\'s scotch recommendation or pour another style of whiskey. An aged rum or a good brandy would make a nice foundation, too.\nHow Strong Is the White Christmas Dream?\nTo estimate how strong the White Christmas Dream is, let\'s assume that you pour an 80-proof vodka and 42-proof amaretto. That means this sweet dessert drink weighs in right around 17 percent ABV (34 proof). It is neither the strongest nor the lightest cocktail you can mix up.

Muddle well to release the juice of the berries and the essence of the mint.\nFill the glass with ice and squeeze in the juice of the lime wedges.\nAdd the rum and raspberry liqueur.\nTop off with ginger ale and stir well.\nGarnish with more raspberries and a sprig of mint. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou can use frozen raspberries; enough to cover the bottom of the glass should do. Thaw the berries first so they're easier to muddle.\nIf you don't have a muddler, use the back of a wooden spoon or the end of a rolling pin.\nTo wake up the mint's flavor, slap the leaves between your palms or gently tear them before adding them to the glass.\nTry wiping the glass rim with a lime wedge to get a refreshing, tart taste with every sip.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch to another lightly flavored soda if you like. Club soda and sparkling waters will not be as sweet as ginger ale and work really well in this mojito. You could also pour sparkling wine; ros? is an excellent choice.\nSkip the raspberry liqueur and pour raspberry rum instead. The cocktail won't be as sweet; make up for that by adding 1/2 ounce of simple syrup or 1 to 2 teaspoons of sugar to the muddle.\nVanilla rum is an excellent alternative to white rum and pairs nicely with raspberries.\nAdd more fruits to the cocktail. Blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries are natural companions for raspberries. You can also muddle in slices of mango, melon, or pineapple.\nSkip the liquors and make this a virgin raspberry mojito. You'll need more soda or can split it with limeade.\nTo make this a pitcher cocktail, multiply the ingredients by the number of servings and prepare in a large pitcher. Mix up the raspberry mojitos up to an hour or two ahead of time, adding the ice and ginger ale just before serving.\nShaking the cocktail makes it even more refreshing: Build the cocktail in a shaker, leaving out the ginger ale. Shake well and strain into a cold collins glass filled with ice. Top off with ginger ale and add mint and raspberry to garnish.\nWhat Is the Best Alcohol for a Mojito?\nFor the best tasting mojito, choose a mid-range rum. There are many great brands to choose from, and rum is one of the most affordable liquors, so you won't break the bank with an upgrade. While white rum is often the preferred style for mojitos, aged rum adds a little more dimension and dark rum is particularly well-suited to raspberries. Many people enjoy vodka mojitos, and this raspberry cocktail works with that spirit as well.\nWhat Can I Use Instead of Mint in a Mojito?\nOther herbs like basil or lemon verbana also work well in a mojito, although the drink won't be a true mojito. You can always leave the herb out, especially when making a fruity mojito like raspberry, but it won't have the same flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Raspberry Mojito?\nThis raspberry mojito is a relatively light cocktail. On average, its alcohol content falls in the 13 percent ABV (26 proof) range. While that is similar to a glass of wine, a few drinks will add up quickly, and the sweet taste can be deceiving.\n22 Fun Raspberry Cocktails to Mix Up""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-mojito-recipe-760479

Add 1/2 cup of sugar to each. Shake to coat the berries and allow to macerate for 30 minutes.\nPour half the vodka into each jar (about 1 1/2 cups per jar). Seal and shake well to dissolve the sugar. Check every 30 minutes and shake again until you're sure the sugar is completely dissolved.\nStore the jars in a cool, dark place for two weeks, shaking every day or two.\nUsing a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth, strain the raspberries from the liqueur. To remove more sediment, empty and rinse the cheesecloth and strain two or three more times.\nFunnel the raspberry liqueur into two 16-ounce (or four 8-ounce) bottles. Seal and store with other liquors in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\nTips\nNearly any vodka works well with this liqueur recipe because the berries and sugar will soften a harsher taste. However, it is best when made with vodka that you'd drink straight, and there are some excellent budget-friendly vodkas available. Try it with a citrus or vanilla vodka base for extra flavor. While most vodka is bottled at 40 percent ABV (80 proof), using 100-proof vodka will create a slightly bolder flavor and higher alcohol content.\nYou can make the liqueur in a single jar that's larger than one quart. Before the fruit breaks down (after about a week), the recipe's volume will overflow a 1-quart jar, so it's best to split it up when using the smaller jar.\nInfuse the liqueur for up to six weeks if you like, particularly when using high-proof vodka. The extra time allows the flavor to develop and mellow even further.\nThis homemade raspberry liqueur has a shelf-life similar to other sugary liqueurs. There's no need to refrigerate it, and it's best to drink it within six months to a year. Depending on how well it's strained, you may want to shake it before pouring.\nRecipe Variations\nNo time for a prolonged infusion? Make a quick raspberry liqueur instead. Start with a raspberry simple syrup by stirring one cup of sugar into one cup of boiling water until dissolved. Add two cups of raspberries, allow to simmer for about five minutes, then remove from heat, cover, and let cool completely. Strain out the berries and mix the syrup with two cups of vodka and add 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract if you like, then bottle your raspberry liqueur.\nGive the liqueur a darker berry taste by replacing half of the raspberries with blackberries.\nAdd extra flavor to create a liqueur that tastes a bit more like the secret formula used for Chambord. For instance, add 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract or a whole split vanilla bean along with the raspberries. Give it a citrus spin with 1/4 cup of orange peels or a deeper background by replacing 1/2 cup of the vodka with brandy. Using two jars allows for experimentation; keep one straight and add half of the ingredients to the second and see how you like the difference.\nFor a darker sweetness, use fine-grain raw sugar. Raw sugars commonly have larger grains, so give it a whirl in the blender to help it dissolve better in the room-temperature liquid.\n\nHow to Serve Homemade Raspberry Liqueur\nRaspberry liqueur is utterly delicious on its own and can be drunk straight or on the rocks. It's also an excellent substitute in raspberry cocktail recipes that use Chambord, raspberry liqueur, or cr?me de framboise. Try it in the French martini or Floradora, and consider increasing the recipe's other sweetener slightly when using it instead of the sweeter cr?me de framboise.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Raspberry Liqueur?\nWithout high-tech equipment, it's difficult to calculate the exact strength of a homemade liqueur that relies on maceration. The sugars added with the technique naturally decrease the vodka's alcohol content, and make it impossible to read on the average home-use hydrometer. However, you can assume that the liqueur falls between 15 percent and 25 percent ABV (30 to 50 proof) and at the upper end with a high-proof vodka. It's the same range you'll find among commercial raspberry liqueurs.\nIs Raspberry Vodka a Good Substitute for Chambord?\nRaspberry vodka can be a substitute for Chambord and other raspberry liqueurs, but you need to consider the vodka and the recipe. Some commercial flavored vodkas are sweetened (typically 35 percent ABV, 70 proof), but not to the extent of turning it into a liqueur, and others (including homemade versions) are a straight infusion of berries in vodka, which results in a 40 percent ABV, 80-proof raspberry vodka. When using raspberry vodka as a substitute for the liqueur, increase the drink's sweetener or add simple syrup to create a balanced cocktail (less with a sweeter vodka and more with an infusion). Consider reducing the drink's vodka (or other base spirits) as well.\nThe Best Flavored Vodkas to Add Extra Oomph to Drinks""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-raspberry-liqueur-recipe-5214344

Using cheap gin will result in a disappointing drink.\nMake sure that your dry vermouth is not outdated.

That means the obituary cocktail is one of the strongest martinis you can mix up. The cocktail\'s alcohol content ranges from 32 percent to 34 percent ABV (64 to 68 proof), which is why it\'s just a 3-ounce drink.

It\'s a matter of personal preference, so mix it how you like it.\nCream of coconut is a nonalcoholic drink mixer that is sweeter than coconut cream. Canned coconut cream or coconut milk can be substituted (you may want to add a sweetener such as simple syrup). Coconut milk sold in cartons will work, but it\'s not as thick or rich as the others.\nThe History of the Painkiller\nThe original Painkiller was created at the Soggy Dollar Bar in the 1970s. The hotspot on the British Virgin Islands was owned by Daphne Henderson. With no dock on the beach, patrons had to swim to shore, getting their money wet along the way. This inspired the bar\'s name.\nThe Painkiller was the Soggy Dollar\'s signature cocktail, and it became famous in the islands. The recipe was a well-kept secret. \nWhen Charles Tobias?who would found Pusser\'s Rum in 1979?befriended Henderson, he tried to figure out the secret recipe. As the story goes, Tobias recreated the drink almost exactly, though people at the Soggy Dollar enjoyed his slightly less sweet version of the bar\'s signature mix.\nThe drink took off, and Tobias trademarked it as Pusser\'s Painkiller. The recipe spread, and it quickly became a modern classic in the tropical cocktail scene.\nBartenders mixed up Painkillers, drinkers enjoyed the fruity concoction, and all went well. That was until a pair of well-known New York City bartenders decided to open a bar called Painkiller. They also offered the namesake cocktail, but their version did not use Pusser\'s. This spurred a trademark lawsuit that ended in the venue changing its name to PKNY (it closed in 2013). As the story unfolded in 2010 and 2011, the bartending community came out in support of the NYC establishment. Several boycotted the rum, and quite a few purposely promoted Painkillers with any rum other than Pusser\'s.\nThough the story of the Painkiller does not change the appeal of the drink, it is an interesting case of who can ""own"" or trademark a cocktail recipe or name. It\'s not the first case in the courts; similar arguments have surrounded the Bacardi cocktail and the dark \'n\' stormy.\nHow Strong Is the Painkiller?\nWhen made with Pusser\'s Blue Label (84 proof in the U.S.), the Painkiller weighs in at 10 percent ABV (20 proof). This is nothing compared to cocktails like the martini (60 proof), but sweet drinks, hot days, and summer sun can quickly get you drunker than you expect.\nRum Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/painkiller-cocktail-recipe-760473

For each half, cut it lengthwise, then slice across the lime three times to make a total of 12 small wedges.\nPlace at least six lime wedges (more to taste) in a chilled old-fashioned glass. Add the sugar and muddle well to mix.\nFill the glass with crushed ice and pour in the vodka\nStir well, incorporating some of the lime into the crushed ice.\nTop with more ice and garnish with extra lime wedges. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe mixing technique is a matter of preference, though this drink relies on a good amount of dilution. Some people enjoy shaking the caipiroska with ice cubes and will pour everything into the glass. You can also roll the drink between two glasses with small cubes or chunky ice.\nA blender can quickly make crushed ice out of ice cubes. To reduce melting, chill the blender pitcher in the freezer for about 10 minutes, then pulse it.\nAlternatively, crush the ice with a mallet or muddler in a lint-free towel or plastic bag. If you enjoy drinks like this often, consider adding a handheld ice crusher or Lewis bag to your bar.\nCrushed ice melts quickly, so this is not a drink to let sit around.\nRecipe Variations\nBrown sugar is richer, so reduce the measurement to about 2 teaspoons when using it as a substitute.\nUse 1 ounce of simple syrup instead of sugar. Infused syrups add extra flavor.\nSwitch to a flavored vodka to customize the taste.\nAdd more fruits to the muddle. A strawberry caipiroska is a favorite variation, and mango and passionfruit are common, too. Nearly any crushable fruit that pairs well with lime will work.\nMuddle herbs, such as mint or rosemary into the drink. Ginger adds a spicy snap, too.\nHow Strong Is the Caipiroska?\nThe caipiroska uses dilution to soften the flavor. The ice melt also reduces the alcohol content over time; its impact is dependent on the form of ice you use. While it's not precise because of that factor, the caipiroska will initially mix up to about 20 percent ABV (40 proof), or about half the vodka's bottling strength.\nVodka Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/caipiroska-cocktail-5071195

You can also heat a water-filled mug in the microwave for about 10 seconds.\nFor this drink to really work, make the richest, strongest cup of coffee possible. Consider adding more ground coffee to your drip brewer or using an alternative brewing method like a French press or pour over system.\nThe rum doesn't have to be anything special (save that for your daiquiris) because of the coffee's bold flavor. A good mid-range light rum will do just fine, though you can add a little more depth with aged rum.\nIf you want to make the caf? Caribbean really special, try it with homemade amaretto. In less than one hour, you can create your own liqueur with a little vodka (try it with rum) and a few common ingredients from the kitchen. The key ingredient is almond extract.\nRecipe Variations\nThe two liquors also make a nice addition to iced coffee, especially if you use a cold brew. Add a splash of RumChata for a quick creamer.\nFor a high-octane version, add the spirits to an espresso shot. If you keep the liquor at 1 1/2 ounces total, a double shot of espresso is best because that's typically 2 ounces. It works well with cappuccino as well.\nIf you skip the amaretto and add two sugar cubes, you'll have a popular German coffee drink called Pharis?er kaffee. It's fun to note that the whipped cream was used to hide the rum's aroma from a pastor in the 1870s.\nSwap the amaretto out for another nutty liqueur. Frangelico and Gabriel Boudier Roasted Hazelnut are great options for the taste of hazelnuts and nocino is a fun walnut liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a Caf? Caribbean?\nThe caf? Caribbean will have a stronger caffeine kick than an alcohol one. With a full six ounces of coffee and 80-proof rum, the drink's alcohol content will be just 7 percent ABV (14 proof).

Others pour as much as 2 ounces, which can be a good route with syrupy colas (e.g., Coke).\nLight rum, spiced rum, even some flavored rums... they can all work well in the lounge lizard. Try it with coconut rum as it\'s a surprisingly good companion to amaretto.\nInstead of amaretto, pour another dark, nutty liqueur.

Simply keep the ingredients in proportion and increase each to the amount you need.\nRecipe Variation\nPineapple juice is a common substitute for orange juice in this drink.\nIs There a Good Substitute for Cr?me de Cassis?\nCr?me de cassis is a black currant-flavored liqueur that also makes an appearance in the Kir and Chimay? cocktails. While not essential in the bar, it\'s a nice, inexpensive liqueur to have around. Though it\'s key in the more traditional bliss on the beach recipe, its infrequent use in the bar has caused many to turn to Chambord as a substitute; the difference between the black currant and black raspberry liqueurs is not significant. Grenadine can also be used.\nWhere Was the Sex on the Beach Created?\nIt is without fail that the true origins of many famous cocktails are a little hazy. This drink is no different and there are a few popular stories circulating. One of the more common accounts for this cocktail\'s creation points to 1987 and the rise of peach schnapps. Reportedly, liquor distributor National Distribution held a contest in Fort Lauderdale, Florida to see which bartender could sell the most peach schnapps. Ted Pizio from the bar Confettis won the $1000 prize thanks to his mix of vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, and grenadine. He gave it the name because ""sex on the beach"" was one of the main reasons to spend spring break in Ft. Lauderdale. While that is a great story, according to some bartenders who worked in the \'80s, this was not the drink\'s first appearance. Some claim to have mixed the drink as early as 1981. There are also stories from that early that refer to the Chambord version under the name ""Florida sunset.""\nWhy Is It Called Sex on the Beach?\nSince the origin is unclear, the true meaning behind the name is as well. However, it likely stems from a scenario similar to the spring break theory. The \'70s and \'80s were filled with tall, fruity, vodka-based drinks and many had the funky, sexy, and sometimes wacky names that get stuck in the minds of drinkers. ""Sex on the beach"" is great for selling drinks, though we like to call it ""bliss on the beach"" because everyone should be comfortable talking about this great drink.\nHow Strong Is the Bliss on the Beach?\nThe bliss on the beach is made primarily of nonalcoholic mixers, so it\'s not as strong as you might expect. Typically, the alcohol content falls in the 11 percent ABV (22 proof) range. It is a very average mixed drink, but it\'s easy to drink, too. This one can sneak up on you.\nWhat Mixes Well With Peach Schnapps?\nPeach schnapps is a sweet, fruity liqueur that\'s a common fixture in bars. Its strength varies, from 20 percent to 50 percent ABV (40 to 80 proof), so some peach schnapps can be stronger than the average vodka. You can drink peach schnapps straight, though some can be rather syrupy and better served on the rocks. It\'s also a versatile mixer and the key ingredient in many peach cocktails. It pairs well with other fruits, including cranberry juice in the woo woo cocktail, though it\'s also delicious when mixed with hot chocolate.\nBartender\'s Guide to the Most Popular Bar Drinks']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sex-on-the-beach-cocktail-recipe-759828

It is both an opportunity to practice your skills with a muddler and a fantastic way to experience the difference fresh ingredients can make. Though not essential, some bartenders like to slap mint leaves before mixing to help release more of the herb\'s essential oils.\nPowdered sugar is not one of the most common ingredients in a bar. If you don\'t have it, don\'t worry. It\'s easy to make yourself from granulated sugar and can be made in as small of a quantity as you need. The only tool required is a blender or coffee grinder.\nYou can also substitute the powdered sugar. Granulated sugar is a good option and no adjustments are needed to the quantity. Simple syrup is the other option. If you use it, you may find that slightly less than 1 teaspoon is required to create a balanced cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nThis cocktail was created by Wild Turkey, so it is only natural that it is the recommended whiskey of choice. Of course, you can use any bourbon you like, however, Wild Turkey has a number of great options to choose from.\nWild Turkey 81 is one of the flagship expressions from the legendary bourbon brand and it would be a top choice for this cocktail. Wild Turkey 101 and Rare Breed are excellent options as well. As you might suspect, the recipe got it\'s ""101"" moniker from Wild Turkey 101, so it\'s recommended that you start with that flavorful bourbon. It has wonderful spice tones that play perfectly against the ginger and mint.\nIf you want to step the drink up yet another notch, try one of the brand\'s limited edition reserve bourbons. Don\'t worry, mixed drinks of this caliber will not be a waste of great whiskey.\n\nHow Strong Is a Manhattan 101?\nManhattans of any variety are not light drinks and this recipe falls in line. If you choose Wild Turkey\'s 81-proof whiskey, the alcohol content of the finished drink is around 27 percent ABV (54 proof). When mixed with Wild Turkey 101, it becomes a potent 33 percent ABV (66 proof). Since it is nearly the strength of a shot of whiskey, you might want to savor the flavor experience of a single drink rather than mix up multiple rounds in a night.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiskey-drinks-with-wild-turkey-bourbon-761394

This will help prevent the syrup from running down the glass too quickly.\nTo rim the cocktail glass, begin by rolling the rim in a shallow dish of caramel syrup.\nRoll the glass in a dish of salt, coating it lightly all the way around.\nIf you want to drizzle caramel inside the glass, hold it upright over the sink to catch any caramel drips. Lightly drizzle caramel webbing inside the glass. Immediately place the glass in the freezer so the caramel sets up while you mix the drink.\nIn a cocktail shaker filled with ice, pour the vanilla vodka, Irish cream, and 1 ounce of caramel syrup.\nShake well.\nRemove the glass from the freezer and strain the drink into it.\nGarnish with caramel candy. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWork quickly while decorating the glass. Have a spot ready in the freezer so you can place the glass in it before the caramel runs too much.\nThe rim and caramel drizzle can be done in advance; a minimum of 10 to 20 minutes is perfect. The colder the caramel is, the longer it will stay frozen while you're drinking the martini.\nYou can use any caramel syrup (but not sauce; it's too thick). Salted caramel syrup is a good choice if you want to skip the salt rim. The variety intended as an ice cream topping will be less runny than syrups used for flavoring coffee and a better choice for the garnish. A homemade caramel sauce gives you a little more control of the consistency.\nPouring caramel?whether from a bottle or spoon?can be inconsistent. To make thin strings in the glass, hold the caramel about arm's length above the glass and let the caramel begin to drip. Once the stream is steady, move your glass under the stream to create a web design. It can be messy, so do it over the sink.\nTo clean caramel out of the glass when the drink is gone, run it under hot water while spinning the glass by the stem. It will dissolve and you can then clean the glass as usual.\nRecipe Variations\nUnflavored vodka works just as well as vanilla vodka for a less sweet drink.\nRamp up the caramel by pouring a caramel vodka instead of vanilla. Give it even more flavor with salted caramel moonshine. For either substitution, cut the caramel syrup in half to maintain balance.\nButterscotch schnapps is a good substitute for caramel syrup.\nRumChata and other cream liqueurs can be used instead of Irish cream. You can also replace it with milk, half and half, or a dairy alternative?almond milk is a perfect fit for this drink.\nHow Strong Is a Salted Caramel Martini?\nAs far as martinis go, this one is a lightweight.

For instance, some Irish cream is almost white while other brands are brown. Butterscotch schnapps may be clear or golden brown. Cinnamon schnapps plays the biggest role, as pouring in red schnapps will result in a pink shooter while clear schnapps will not affect the color.\nRecipe Variations\nSlow-sipping cookie cocktail: Double the recipe or add a shot of vodka or spiced rum, shake it up, and strain into an old-fashioned or cocktail glass. When serving it on the rocks, use fresh ice in the glass. Garnish the cocktail with raisins skewered on a cocktail pick, or dress up the glass with a sweet and crunchy rim by dipping it in butterscotch schnapps and then rolling it in crushed oatmeal cookies.\nFruity cookie cocktail: Give your shot a hint of orange while skipping the cinnamon schnapps and J?germeister. An orange liqueur with a brandy base like Grand Marnier is the best fit. Shake equal parts orange liqueur, butterscotch schnapps, and Irish cream and strain it into a shot glass.\nOatmeal-raisin cookie cocktail: Add rum and coffee liqueur. Shake 1/2 ounce each of J?germeister, cinnamon schnapps, rum, coffee liqueur, and Irish cream with ice and strain. It will fill two shot glasses or make one large drink in an old-fashioned glass.\nSwap the liqueurs: J?germeister is not in every oatmeal cookie shot, but some recipes call for 1/2 ounce or more; the liqueur does have a strong flavor, so add it to taste or simply make the drink without it. Some oatmeal cookie recipes call for an equal pour of the butterscotch, cream, and cinnamon liqueurs. For the average shot glass, measure out between 1/3 and 1/2 ounce of each.\nHow Strong Is the Oatmeal Cookie Shot?\nThough it packs a punch, the oatmeal cookie is pretty tame when compared to other shooters. The alcohol content falls in the 15 percent ABV (30 proof) range, or just a little stronger than a glass of wine. If you mix up the oatmeal raisin cookie, it jumps up to 28 percent ABV (56 proof) with an 80-proof rum and will be even stronger with the over-proof rum option.\nShots & Shooter Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/oatmeal-cookie-shot-recipe-759754

Simply place the blended cocktail in the freezer until it's time to serve and enjoy the blender-free party atmosphere.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can also skip the fresh berries and shake up this margarita with a raspberry liqueur like Chambord or cr?me de framboise. Homemade raspberry syrup is also easy to make, and it can be the foundation for making your own liqueur. Use about 1 ounce of either ingredient along with the tequila, lime juice, and triple sec as called for in the recipe.\nYou can also use the recipe to create a fruit medley margarita by adding other berries, like blackberries and chopped strawberries. It's very easy to make small changes like this to blended cocktails and creating new drinks on the fly is half the fun of making them yourself. \nSkip the blender: It's simple to adapt this frozen margarita into a shaken version, and all you really need to do is skip the blender and extra ice. You can even get away with about 1/4 cup of raspberries because it's a rather juicy little fruit. When using fresh raspberries, muddle them in your cocktail shaker before adding the rest of the ingredients and filling it with ice. To use frozen berries, allow them to thaw out before muddling and shaking.\nHow Strong Is the Raspberry Margarita?\nThe nice thing about blended cocktails is that all the ice transforms it into a relatively light drink. When made with an 80-proof tequila, this recipe weighs in at just over 7 percent ABV (14 proof). In comparison, if you were to shake the drink with the exact same ingredients, it would be around 20 percent ABV (40 proof).\n22 Fun Raspberry Cocktails to Mix Up""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-margarita-recipe-760860

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you're not the biggest fan of sugar rims, only do half of the glass. It gives you (and your guests) the option of sipping through the sugar or not.\nFor the best muddling results, remove the green top from your strawberries, rinse them well, then cut the berries into thick slices.\nFresh lemon juice is going to produce the best cocktail. The average lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces of juice, which is more than enough for a few drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can skip the fresh strawberry muddle and replace the syrup with strawberry simple syrup. This is a great way to preserve berries before they go bad so you can enjoy this cocktail over a couple of weeks. It's also a nice shortcut when you want to serve it at a party.\nMake party service even easier by mixing up the drink's base (everything except the wine) in a pitcher. Keep the proportions intact and multiply each ingredient by the number of servings needed or to fill the pitcher. Keep it cool in the refrigerator, then pour it into the serving glasses and top it with Champagne.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Vodka Champagne Cocktail?\nThis cocktail has a long pour of vodka, which makes it just a little stronger.

Stir well.\nSlowly add the Champagne and ginger ale.\nGarnish with pomegranate seeds and other seasonal fruit, mint, or citrus slices.\nLadle into individual serving glasses, including a few fruits in each. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nChoose any sparkling wine you like. Though the recipe says ""Champagne,"" other varieties will do just fine. Prosecco is often a favorite and it tends to be a more budget-friendly option over true French Champagne.\nKeep in mind that Champagnes are often classified as either brut (dry) and sec (sweet). When choosing one, consider how sweet the rest of the punch is. In this recipe, for instance, you might want to go with a dry wine to offset the rather sweet fruit juices.\nAdd the wine and soda at the very last minute. This will keep the punch sparkling throughout the party. To save time, mix the other ingredients in advance and store them in the refrigerator until it\'s time to serve the punch.\nYou\'ll notice that many Champagne punches also include ginger ale or another soda. This adds to the carbonation and volume without bringing in any extra alcohol. Feel free to add a second bottle of wine instead.\nHow Many People Will the Punch Serve?\nThis recipe makes 75 ounces of punch; just over 1/2 gallon and 16 to 18 servings. The standard punch serving is 4 ounces, perfect for the average small punch cup (with room for ice if needed and space to prevent spilling). Most party planners estimate that each person drinks one glass per hour and that accounts for guests who don\'t drink and those who drink more. It\'s easy to adjust punch recipes to fit the size of your party, so increase or decrease it as needed.\nIf you\'re using a single punch bowl, have some punch in reserve: Mix the juices, syrup, and vodka and store the pitcher in the fridge. When it\'s time to refill the bowl, pour the punch base along with the wine and soda.\n\nRecipe Variations\nPomegranate juice is not cheap. If you want to save money, pick up a pomegranate-cranberry juice blend and use it instead of the individual juices. It won\'t have the pomegranate focus but it will be just as tasty.\nRather than cinnamon, use rosemary syrup. It\'s made in the same way and its floral flavor is also perfect for a winter Champagne punch.\nPlay with your ice. Adding complementary fruits and herbs in ice cubes or rings while they freeze is a nice touch that adds flavor and style to the punch bowl.\nAdd seasonal fruits. Sparkling punches are meant to be adorned with the best fruits of the season. When in doubt, lemon, lime, and orange slices are always good choices.\nHow to Avoid Watered-Down Punch\nMost parties last for a few hours and you\'ll want to take steps to keep your punch from getting overly diluted. The best ways are to chill all of the ingredients and use ice rings or big chunks of ice which will melt slower. You can also use fruit juice rather than water for the ice, or mix equal parts of juice and ice. Freezing the sparkling wine is an option, though the alcohol prevents it from freezing as solid as water so it remains a little slushy. Another option is to place the punch bowl in a deep, decorative platter or larger insulated bowl packed with ice. It shouldn\'t melt too fast but you\'ll want to keep an eye out for leaks if the party lasts a while.\nHow Strong Is a Champagne Punch?\nDespite adding a full cup of vodka, all of the juices bring this punch down to a pleasant strength for a party. On average, it will mix up to a mild 9 percent ABV (18 proof). That is lighter than a glass of Champagne, so you shouldn\'t have to worry about too many drunken blunders if a guest has one too many glasses!\n25 Best Party Punch Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/champagne-punch-recipes-759621

While the Cointreau and cream have remained constants, some recipes are specific about the coffee liqueur or replace it entirely.\nKahlua may be the best-known coffee liqueur, but the velvet hammer is typically made with Tia Maria. Both have a rum base and use coffee beans and vanilla for flavor, so they are very similar. It\'s a matter of personal taste and you can certainly make this drink with any other coffee liqueur.\nAt times, a chocolate liqueur is substituted for the coffee option. The pairing of chocolate and orange is just as delicious and we find it on occasion in cocktails like the chocolate and orange martini. Most often, cr?me de cacao is preferred over the creamier chocolate liqueurs.\nThe velvet hammer also works well with a tall shot of brandy or cognac.\nBlend It Up. While the velvet hammer is quite tasty on the rocks, it\'s also a worthy mix for the blender. It creates a boozy milkshake with a very intriguing flavor and some people even like to add a shot of brandy. There are two ways to approach this one.\nThe first is to simply pour the three ingredients into a blender with about a cup of ice.\nThe other, much creamier, option is to skip the cream and add a scoop or two of vanilla ice cream instead. Use more ice cream if you like a thicker shake and less for a thinner consistency.\nHow strong Is the Velvet Hammer?\nThe velvet hammer seems like an innocent drink because it\'s made of sweet liqueurs, which tend to have a lower alcohol content. Cointreau is actually a 40 percent alcohol by volume (80 proof) liqueur, making it as strong as most rums, vodkas, and whiskeys. On average, your velvet hammer should weigh in around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). It\'s not the strongest drink, but it\'s not the weakest, either. The sweet, creamy taste can also mask the alcohol, so it\'s best to take it easy with this one.\nWhy Is it Called a Velvet Hammer?\nThe phrase ""velvet hammer"" implies something that is soft but also packs a punch. It\'s a fitting name for this cocktail because the sweet cream hides the cocktail\'s alcohol, so drinking one too many can leave a lasting impact.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/velvet-hammer-recipe-759842

Adding ice is a quick fix if it's too thin for your taste.\nNo sour mix? Simply add a splash of lemon or lime juice and a touch of simple syrup or sugar to the blender instead.\nBlanco tequilas are used most often for frozen drinks. Also, with all the flavors here, there's really no need to pour your best tequila, so you can save some money.\nFresh fruit will make the freshest tasting margarita and it's highly recommended. However, frozen strawberries and canned pineapple will make a rather tasty drink as well. You can also add more of either fruit to suit your taste.\nTo get the smoothest blend, chop the ice and fruits in the blender before adding the rest of the ingredients.\nPrevent your margarita from becoming a slushie mess before you're done with it by serving it in a frosty glass.\nRecipe Variations\nIt's easy to change the color of this margarita by switching from triple sec to blue cura?ao. Because of the fruits, it won't be a true blue like the blue margarita, but more of a purple. The taste will not change from the original Hawaiian margarita.\nIf you skip the pineapple chunks, you will be left with the very popular strawberry margarita.\nFor a unique twist when strawberries aren't in season, try the tamarind-pineapple margarita. All you need is some pineapple juice and tamarind nectar, an ingredient that's relatively easy to find with the juices in most grocery stores.\nHow Strong Is a Hawaiian Margarita?\nThe lovely part about frozen margaritas is that they're relatively tame drinks. All that ice and fruit knock down the tequila's strength significantly, so the Hawaiian margarita has an average alcohol content of just 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That's similar to drinking a beer, but a whole lot more delicious.\nThis Slushy TikTok Trend Seemed Too Good to Be True¡¦ So I Tested It for Myself""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hawaiian-margarita-frozen-759686

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIce cubes are difficult to measure. Generally, 5 or 6 average-sized cubes can be constituted as 1 cup. For this recipe, use 3 ice cubes or measure out 1/2 cup of crushed ice.\nOnce blended, if the mix is too thick for your taste, add an extra splash of lime juice or cream of coconut. If it's too thin, add more ice or ice cream. After each addition, blend again.\nThe brandy doesn't have to be from your best bottle. A good mid-range brandy that you'd pour into a brandy Alexander will do just fine.\nCream of coconut is a sweetened, richer, and thicker version of coconut cream and the preferred ingredient for pi?a coladas. In frozen cocktails like this, however, either will work. Coconut milk is a great choice as well since this recipe adds ice cream.\nRecipe Variation\nJust like the pi?a colada, you can certainly skip the blender and shake up the kappa colada. Adjustments need to be made and it's best to simply substitute the brandy into the original pi?a colada recipe. In this version, shake 2 ounces each of brandy and pineapple juice and 1 1/2 ounces cream of coconut with ice. Strain it into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish.\nIf you want the best of both cocktails, split the rum and brandy into two equal pours. For instance, using the kappa colada recipe, pour 1 ounce of each liquor rather than 2 ounces of brandy.\nHow Strong Is a Kappa Colada?\nThe kappa colada is surprisingly strong for a frozen cocktail. It cuts the normal amount of ice in half and makes up for only a portion of that difference with the ice cream. This one should blend up to an alcohol content around 15 percent ABV (30 proof). It's twice the strength of the average blended drink, but still close to a glass of wine.\nThis Slushy TikTok Trend Seemed Too Good to Be True¡¦ So I Tested It for Myself""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/kappa-colada-recipe-759444

However, that does not rule out a quality blanco; the reposado simply adds a bit of depth.\nAs with any spicy cocktail, start slow on the hot sauce and add more to suit your taste. This is really easy with blended cocktails because you can use a spoon to taste test it before pouring and any adjustment will just require another whirl of the blender.

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nDry gin is often poured for the Park Avenue, just make sure it's top-shelf and worthy of a martini. You can also try it with other styles of gin, including an old-school version like Old Tom or a modern take such as Hendrick's.\nTo make this drink with fresh pineapple instead of juice, place about 3/4 cup of pineapple chunks in the shaker. Muddle the fruit really well to release as much juice as possible. Then add the other ingredients and ice, shake, and strain.\nThe choice of orange cura?ao is important even though it's a very short pour. Premium options like Gabriel Boudier and Senior Cura?ao are excellent choices, though some people enjoy Grand Marnier instead.\nMake sure your sweet vermouth is fresh. Once open, the fortified wine's shelf life is just three months, after which it will go stale. When in doubt, pick up a new bottle.\nRecipe Variations\nThe ingredients in this recipe can be adjusted to suit your taste. One common recipe, for instance, includes up to 1 ounce of pineapple juice with 1/2 ounce each of the cura?ao and vermouth.\nAnother pours equal amounts of the three accent ingredients, cutting them back to as little as 1/3 ounce.\nSome recipes also skip the cura?ao completely.\nAt least one semi-classic variation on the Park Avenue is a perfect martini with a little pineapple juice. To make it, shake 1 1/2 ounces of gin with 1/4 ounce each of sweet and dry vermouths and pineapple juice.\nHow Strong Is a Park Avenue Cocktail?\nThe Park Avenue cocktail falls in line with the rest of the martini family in that it's not a light drink. It will vary depending on what you pour and how much of each ingredient, though its alcohol content should always be around 22 percent ABV (44 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/park-avenue-cocktail-recipe-759334

The point is to add just a touch of sparkle that opens up the whiskey's flavors. It's a similar effect to drinking bourbon and water, but with the sweetener.\nReduce the amount of simple syrup if you prefer. Even a small splash can be enough for some whiskeys and you'll want to adjust this according to each whiskey's flavor profile.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a number of very similar whiskey cocktails that you might want to try after enjoying the stone wall:\nThe stone fence cocktail tops a 2-ounce shot of bourbon with apple cider and 2 dashes of bitters. It's served over ice in a double rocks glass and stirred.\nBoth the John Collins and whiskey fizz are served tall in highball glasses. Each adds a little lemon juice and sugar to the whiskey-soda mix.\nTo make the Presbyterian cocktail, you'll mix both club soda and ginger ale with a shot of whiskey. It's tall and refreshing, with the ginger ale offering a touch of sweetness without going overboard.\nThe classic whiskey highball simply pairs whiskey with ginger ale for a considerable amount of sweetness and sparkle.\nHow Strong Is a Stone Wall?\nThe stone wall will be just a little weaker than the whiskey you pour. For instance, with a 90 proof whiskey, the drink's alcohol content is 34 percent ABV (68 proof). It's a refreshing strength that retains the whiskey's full flavor, which is why this is a great recipe.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/stone-wall-cocktail-recipe-761504

Add the sugar, stirring constantly until dissolved and the syrup is clear.\nUse a paring knife to carefully split the vanilla bean in half lengthwise. Reduce the heat to low, add the vanilla bean, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the syrup steep for 8 hours before removing the vanilla bean.\nTo make the liqueur, combine the vodka and brandy in a 1-quart jar. Add 1/2 cup of the vanilla syrup, shake vigorously for at least 30 seconds to combine, and taste. Add a little more syrup at a time until it reaches your desired flavor.\nBottle the vanilla liqueur and use in your favorite drinks.\nTips\nVanilla beans are expensive, so the recipe makes a large batch of vanilla syrup. It yields about 1 1/2 cups, and you won't need all of it for the liqueur. The excess will keep in the fridge for about two weeks in a sealed jar or bottle. Use it instead of plain simple syrup in cocktails, to sweeten coffee or tea, or top an ounce or two of the syrup with seltzer for homemade vanilla soda.\nA few tiny vanilla bean seeds will end up in the syrup, and there's no need to strain them out. The syrup is very thick, so if you want to remove the seeds, it's best to strain the finished liqueur through a layer of cheesecloth.\nFor the best results, use a premium vodka that's clean and smooth; one you'd drink straight or in a vodka martini is a great choice.\nThe brandy should be mid-shelf, and both liquors 80 proof for the smoothest flavor.\n\nHow to Serve Vanilla Liqueur\nThe vanilla liqueur is an excellent digestif to enjoy straight in a chilled glass or over ice after dinner. It's also enjoyable as a highball when topped with seltzer or club soda in a tall ice-filled glass. Cocktails like the apple pie martini and mile high Manhattan are ideal for this style of vanilla liqueur. While it doesn't have the complex flavor, it is a softer substitute for vanilla-forward liqueurs like Galliano L'Autentico and Tuaca. You can also make dessert a little extra special and drizzle it over ice cream or something like a lemon pound cake.\nHow to Store\nDue to the sugar, liqueurs have a limited shelf life. Drink the vanilla liqueur within six months, keeping the bottle sealed and stored in a cool place out of direct light. It doesn't need to be refrigerated but can be if you often enjoy it chilled. Over time, the sugars may crystallize, and that's a good sign that it's time to make a new batch.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a quicker vanilla liqueur, skip the vanilla bean and add 1/2 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the syrup. It is ready to blend with the liquors as soon as the syrup cools.\nAdd extra flavor to the syrup. Infuse the boiling water with about one tablespoon of green cardamom, ginger, lavender, or rosemary (or a combination) and simmer for a few minutes, strain, then add the sugar and vanilla bean to make the syrup. Add liquid flavorings directly to the syrup; try 1/4 teaspoon of almond or coconut extract or just a splash of rose water.\nMake a nonalcoholic vanilla liqueur for mocktails with zero-proof spirits as the base. Replace the vodka with a light botanical non-alcoholic spirit (gin alternatives and citrus-forward options are great), and use a nonalcoholic rum or whiskey instead of brandy. Since these spirits have unique flavor profiles, they can produce some fascinating background flavors. When experimenting, try half a batch of vanilla liqueur.\n\nHow Strong Is Homemade Vanilla Liqueur?\nFalling in the average range for a liqueur, your homemade vanilla liqueur should be around 28 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 56 proof).\nHomemade Amaretto Liqueur""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/vanilla-liqueur-recipe-5216818

Seal the jar and shake well. Let infuse for 10 to 14 days, storing the jar in a cool, dark place, and shaking daily.\nWhen ready to make the liqueur, bring 227 grams (1 cup) of water to a boil in a small pot. Stir in the sugar until completely dissolved, reduce heat, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. This should yield about 1 1/4 cups of simple syrup.\nOnce the botanical infusion is done, strain it in a cheesecloth-lined fine-mesh strainer to remove the botanicals. Strain one or two more times (rinsing the cheesecloth after each session) if you'd like a clearer spirit.\nCombine the infused liquor with the simple syrup. Stir in the citric acid (if using) and the remaining 1/2 cup of water (use more or less to taste). Add about 20 drops of red food coloring to reach the desired red coloring.\nBottle the homemade Campari in a 750-milliliter bottle or 1-quart jar under a tight seal. Store at room temperature in a cool, dark place, just like any other liquor.\nRecipe Tips\nFor consistent results, weigh the ingredients with metric units on a kitchen scale.\nUsing fresh?rather than the suggested dried?citrus peels may decrease the shelf life of your homemade Campari. To quickly dry citrus peels, cut the peels from fresh oranges and lemons using a vegetable peeler (you'll need about two of each fruit), then dry in a 200 F oven on a parchment-lined baking sheet for 25 to 30 minutes.\nThe botanicals are readily available online and at some herbal shops. Avoid using ground options; the recipe is designed for the cut and sifted versions, which are bulky and that makes them easier to measure and strain.\nThis recipe uses a light (not rich) simple syrup which cuts the alcohol content and gently sweetens the bitter spirit. It's mixed at three parts infused spirit to two parts syrup; keep that ratio in mind when increasing a batch.\nCitric acid (or sour salt) is a powdered preservative that's commonly used to boost the flavor of commercial sodas, syrups, and liqueurs. It can be found at stores that sell home canning supplies and natural foods, as well as online retailers.\nOnce you add the syrup and water to the infused liquor, it's likely that this homemade spirit will be cloudier than commercial Campari. It will affect the look of cocktails but not the taste.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than using more syrup, you can cut the spirit with one cup or more of water to soften the flavor and reduce the alcohol content.\nYou can use 151-proof neutral grain alcohol, though the finished infusion needs to be cut with more water because a higher alcohol content intensifies the bitter flavor. Follow the recipe, then add one cup of water to reach 28 percent ABV, and adjust to taste. This produces about 42 ounces (slightly more than one liter).\nIf you'd like to experiment more with botanicals, steep each separately in equal parts of alcohol then blend the individual infused spirits to taste. This helps you understand the individual flavor and properties of each botanical without committing them to the full batch. For instance, cut and sifted rhubarb root is commonly found in DIY Campari recipes. While a nice addition, it creates a yellow alcohol that will easily stain any porous surfaces you're working with, including wood and cloth. The flavor is not too noticeable to be missed in the final blend, and the mess can be more of a hassle than it's worth.\n\nHow to Use Homemade Campari\nYour homemade version can be used just like regular Campari. It's a bitter liqueur, so might take some getting used to unless you're a seasoned Campari drinker. When you want to relax the flavor, serve the DIY Campari on the rocks or make a Campari and soda. It works very well in classic Campari cocktails like the Americano, Boulevardier, and Negroni. The ap?ritif is also fun in myriad modern drink recipes, such as the cold in the shadows where it's paired with raspberry liqueur and IPA beer.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Campari\nThe strength of your homemade Campari will depend on how much syrup and water you add. When made according to the recipe, it will be around 30 percent ABV (60 proof). Commercial Campari is bottled between 20.5 percent and 28 percent (depending on the market), so this DIY version offers a bit of room to adjust it to taste.\nHomemade Amaretto Liqueur""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-campari-recipe-5210931

While you can do it quickly in the freezer, you do need to be cautious about it. When the syrup gets too cold it will become too thick and won't pour well over the ice. If you choose to freeze it, check it every few minutes.\nFollowing the recipe, you'll have about 1 1/2 cups of syrup. If you pour 1 ounce over each snow cone, it will yield 12 servings.\nThe syrup can be bottled and stored in the refrigerator for a week or two. Adding the alcohol helps preserve it so it lasts longer than regular simple syrups.\nMake the Fireball Jon Snow Cone\nWhen it's time to serve, use an ice cream scoop or large spoon to fill the glasses of your choice with shaved ice (about 1 cup per serving).\nDrizzle the syrup on top, saturating the ice as much as you like.\nServe with a small spoon and enjoy!\nThere's no need to buy paper snow cone cups. Any short glass, sundae dish, small bowl, or even a cocktail or margarita glass will do fine for serving. Actually, they're easier, cleaner, cheaper, and better for the environment. Look around the kitchen and get creative.\nHow Strong Is a Fireball Jon Snow Cone?\nIt's tricky to estimate the alcohol content of a spiked snow cone because the ice is a big factor. The syrup itself will mix up to 11 percent ABV (22 proof) and that will be diluted significantly as you eat the ice. Essentially, it's very light and one snow cone shouldn't be much stronger than drinking a beer.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can certainly skip the liquor and make this a non-alcoholic snow cone. Essentially, you'll be making a cinnamon syrup with cranberry juice instead of water. To do so, add a cinnamon stick while making the syrup and use equal parts of sugar and water (a substitute for the whiskey). Simmer the syrup for 15 minutes, keep it covered, and allow it to cool on the stove before removing the cinnamon. \nNot everyone enjoys Fireball, so feel free to use a substitute. Your favorite cinnamon schnapps will be great here. Goldschlager's a fun choice and the gold flakes add a nice touch.\nIf you like, make your own cinnamon-infused vodka, tequila, or whiskey for the syrup. A good cinnamon flavor should take about 5 to 7 days with a few cinnamon sticks, so plan ahead. The tequila is quite tasty and fun to play around with in other cocktails.\nCreating Shaved Ice at Home\nShaved ice machines are your best option for making an authentic snow cone at home. There are a variety of models available, from inexpensive manual shavers to high-powered machines. Yet, if you don't have a machine you can still make snow cones.\nFake Shaved Ice in the Blender\nWith a good blender that has multiple settings and some nice power behind it, you can get pretty close to real shaved ice. It's a bit more of a puree than the fluffy ice that the shavers make, but it's still a tasty frozen treat. If you're not sure that you're ready to invest in a shaver, get your blender out and give it a try.\nFirst of all, make sure that you have plenty of ice cubes on hand because you'll need more than you expect. Start making your own cubes a few days ahead and store them in a freezer bag to free up your ice trays or freezer's ice maker. In a pinch, buy a bag of ice but keep this well-frozen as it's typically smaller ice that will melt more quickly. \nYour ice needs to be very solid so it doesn't get soupy in the blender and you don't waste a bunch trying to get it thick enough.\nFill the pitcher of your blender about halfway with ice cubes.\nUse the chop or pulse setting to crush the ice in small bursts.\nContinue the bursts until the ice breaks down into fine and consistent crushed ice. It should take a few minutes and you may need to move the contents around to ensure all the cubes are hit by the blades.\nAdd more ice, small amounts at a time and continue pulsing until you have as much ice as you need. If your ice is too thin and watery, add more cubes. Work quickly so the ice doesn't melt.\nStore your shaved ice in the freezer until you're ready for a round of snow cones.\nKorean Shaved Ice Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/fireball-jon-snow-cone-recipe-4145392

Bols Vanilla offers one of the cleanest (as in vanilla-only) options.\nGalliano, Licor 43, and Tuaca are good choices as well. Each of those includes other flavoring ingredients?primarily herbs and botanicals?which will add a nice depth to the drink.\nYou can also make your own vanilla liqueur. It's as easy as making a vanilla-flavored syrup then using that to sweeten brandy or vodka.\nFor the passion fruit juice, you can either make it from fresh passion fruit or buy it at the store. The second option can be difficult because it's often included in a blend with other tropical fruits. Look for straight passion fruit juice within natural and international food sections at the grocery store or at specialty markets.\nRecipe Variations\nA lemon peel or twist makes a fabulous garnish substitute.\nSwitch to a ros? Champagne if you like. Mo?t & Chandon makes a wonderful ros? and the soft red fruit flavor is a fantastic pairing for passion fruit.\nPour a vanilla vodka or rum instead of the liqueur. The vodka is incredibly easy to find from many brands and a few rum producers offer it (e.g., Admiral Nelson and Cruzan).\nMango and papaya are good alternatives to passion fruit and would be fabulous in this cocktail. You could even use pineapple juice to retain that tropical taste.\nHow Strong Is a Golden Glamour Cocktail?\nThis cocktail is delightfully low-proof and will be just a little lighter than the sparkling wine you pour.

Serve and enjoy.\nFresh-Pressed Cranberry Juice\nWhen cranberries are in season, this drink is amazing with freshly pressed cranberry juice. The fruit is very tart on its own, so if you want to simply muddle them in the shaker, you may need to add more simple syrup (try 3/4 ounce).\nAnother option is to sweeten the cranberries with a traditional stovetop method that's often used to prepare cranberries for food recipes. For fresh cranberry juice, you'll need 1 cup of cranberries, 1/2 cup of water, and 1/4 cup of sugar.\nIn a saucepan that's large enough so the cranberries are in a single layer, cover the berries with water and add the sugar.\nUse medium heat and keep stirring until all the cranberries pop.\nRemove from the heat right away and let it cool.\nYou can then muddle the berries the rest of the way in the pan and strain out the solids. Alternatively, add the amount needed to your shaker, muddle them with the rosemary, and fine strain the cocktail by using a mesh strainer over the glass.\nHow Strong Is a La Vie En Rouge?\nGrand Marnier may be a liqueur but it's actually as strong as the majority of tequilas, vodkas, and whiskeys. Bottled at 80 proof, this cocktail is not going to be as light as you might think. It's not too strong, though, and mixes up to 13 percent ABV (26 proof), which is similar to wine.\nRecipe Variation\nWhen making this drink by the pitcher, it's easier to skip the muddle and make rosemary simple syrup instead.\nFor a 60-ounce pitcher, combine 20 ounces (2 1/2 cups) each of Grand Marnier and cranberry juice with 6 ounces (3/4 cup) each of lemon juice and rosemary syrup. Stir and adjust to taste (more cranberry or syrup for sweetness or lemon juice if it's too sweet).\nServe the chilled punch in glasses filled with ice, adding a few rosemary needles or a lemon twist as a garnish. It should create 13 four-ounce servings.\nIf you'd like a stronger rosemary flavor, add a full sprig to the pitcher and let it infuse for a few hours.

It should keep well for several weeks. It is the perfect warm drink to relax with after a long day at work and with the batter all ready to go, it's as easy as warming up the tea kettle. \nTo Make Hot Buttered Whiskey\nNow that you have the batter, it's time to make the drink! This is the easy part and the point where your (not so) hard work pays off.\nSlice off a good dollop of the batter (about 1 ounce) and add it to a warmed mug or Irish coffee glass.\nAdd the whiskey and fill with hot water.*\nStir well.\nServe and enjoy.\n*How much water? You want to create a smooth, rich consistency and avoid watering down the drink. Most of the time, you will use 3 to 4 ounces of water and you don't need to fill the glass all the way (especially if using an over-sized coffee mug). Instead, begin with about twice as much water as whiskey, see how you like it, and adjust from there.\nWhich Whiskey to Choose?\nYou really won't know which whiskey you like best in the Hot Buttered Whiskey until you try them. Almost any whiskey will be good and many will be great. While you have the batter in the fridge, experiment with a few different brands and styles. There's sure to be one in your list of favorites that outshines all the others.\nTry it with a sweeter bourbon if you like a softer, sweeter drink.\nBring out more spice notes with a high-proof bourbon or a great rye whiskey.\nLooking for a super smooth taste? Opt for one of the great blended Canadian whiskies.\nFollow the line of thought from the Irish Coffee recipe and pour Irish whiskey.\nFor an even more unusual twist, try a Hot Buttered Single Malt Scotch for a truly spectacular drink.\nHow Strong Is the Hot Buttered Whiskey?\nWith all these whiskey options as well as the unknown volume of water, we're going to have to do some serious estimating on the Hot Buttered Whiskey's alcohol content. To do so, let's assume that you pour an 80-proof whiskey and use just 3 ounces of hot water.

Enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can serve it on the rocks if you prefer, which might be necessary if enjoying it poolside in a warm climate.\nYou can adjust the amount of rum to suit your taste or even leave it out for a virgin coquito.\nHow Strong Is a Coquito?\nWhite rum has an ABV of 40 percent (80 proof). Combined with coconut cream, sweetened condensed milk, and evaporated milk, the finished drink weighs in at about 9 percent ABV. It\'s a relatively light drink and is even lighter if served over ice.

The lighter flavors of this recipe will not cover up any undesirable flavors, so a rum that you enjoy on its own or in a daiquiri will really shine here.\nIf possible, use fresh pineapple juice. An electric juicer is the easiest method and yields the highest amount of juice.\nYou can also muddle chunks of pineapple in your cocktail shaker. This does not produce a lot of juice, so don\'t strain out the pulp to create a juice. Instead, crush about 1/2 cup of pineapple as thoroughly as possible, then add the other ingredients and shake for at least 30 seconds before straining the drink.\nRather than the common neon red maraschino cherries, which are artificially flavored and dyed, choose a quality cherry to garnish this and other cocktails. Luxardo makes real maraschinos and other companies offer ""cocktail"" cherries that are beautiful and natural as well. You can also make your own maraschinos when cherries are in season.\nA chilled glass is preferred with any cocktail that\'s served ""up"" and without ice. If you don\'t have one chilled ahead of time, toss a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix the drink, then discard them before straining.\nHow Strong Is a Mary Pickford Cocktail?\nThe equal pour of pineapple juice and rum helps make the Mary Pickford a low-proof cocktail, especially when compared to other drinks in the martini family.

Allow this to sit for a few minutes, then discard the water.\nPour the Irish whiskey, Irish cream, and butterscotch schnapps into the warm mug.\nFill with coffee, and stir.\nTop with whipped cream and a drizzle caramel syrup. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nBy preheating your glass, the drink will stay warmer longer. It's easy to do with the water from your teapot. Alternatively, you can heat the water-filled glass in the microwave for about 10 seconds.\nAs with any coffee drink, the caramel Irish coffee is best with freshly brewed coffee. The liquors act as sweeteners and creamers, so the stronger your coffee is, the better your drink will be.\nWhipped cream in a can?such as Reddi Wip?is super easy to use and lets you create a beautiful mound on top of the drink. If you like a kitchen project, consider making your own whipped cream. It's easy and stores well so you can enjoy this drink a few days in a row.\nFor the caramel syrup, all you really need is ice cream topping. Alternatively, you can use a syrup designed to flavor coffees, such as those made by Torani or Amoretti. Be careful with these because they may pour out rather than drizzle unless you have a pump-top dispenser on the bottle.\nRecipe Variations\nIrish whiskey makes a true Irish coffee, but don't worry if you run out! Any style of whiskey other than a super-smoky scotch or a spicy rye should do just fine in this cocktail. Try it with bourbon or a smooth Canadian blend.\nIf you're not a fan of butterscotch, try another liqueur as a substitute. A few that would work great are amaretto, a hazelnut liqueur like Frangelico, or an herbal liqueur like Benedictine. Chocolate liqueurs are a delicious alternative, too.\nBaileys is the most famous Irish cream on the market, but you can certainly pour any other brand and get a delicious cocktail. If you like, replace it with RumChata or a similar cream liqueur.\nHow Strong Is the Caramel Irish Coffee?\nThe caramel Irish coffee is a delightfully mild drink. Even with the three liquors, it has an average alcohol content around 13 percent ABV (26 proof). In the cocktail world, that's pretty low, and it's about the same as a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/caramel-irish-coffee-recipe-761342

However, orange juice is a different story, and you'll save money and have a better-tasting drink if you take a minute to squeeze a little fresh juice. It's easy and doesn't require a fancy juicer.\nServe it as a punch: The Madras is a drink that is perfect for mixing up ahead of time to be served as a party punch. Simply increase the ingredients and stir them in a pitcher and chill until it is time to serve. Add a few slices of orange, and you have a super easy punch that your guests will love.\nAdd a little sparkle: Top the Madras with seltzer, club soda, or ginger ale. Add sparkling wine to transform it into a brilliant brunch cocktail as well.\nTry another fruity vodka favorite: While the Madras may be an easy drink to make, it can be easily switched up a bit. If you enjoy this one, mix up one of its vodka-cranberry cousins like the sea breeze (vodka-cranberry-grapefruit) and bay breeze (vodka-cranberry-pineapple).\nHow Strong Is the Madras?\nIn reality, you can make mixed drinks like the Madras as strong or as light as you like. It is just a matter of adding more or pouring less juice.

One lemon wedge is usually a good amount, though you might enjoy it with a little extra citrus.\nPreheating the glass ensures your toddy stays warm a little longer. You can also place the water-filled glass in the microwave for about 5 or 10 seconds.\nRecipe Variations\nCreate a hot gin toddy with your favorite gin. This one's perfect for when you need warming up.\nDon't feel like liquor tonight? Simply skip the booze and you have a hot not toddy.\nAgave nectar is an excellent substitute for the sweetener. It will retain the richness of honey and is vegan.\nAnother sweetener option is simple syrup, which is nothing more than sugar transformed into a liquid (which you can make at home). These syrups can also be flavored. Cinnamon syrup is an excellent choice, or you could have fun with the likes of a cranberry spice syrup.\nIf you don't have a liquid sweetener, simply stir in 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. The warm tea will dissolve it quickly.\nFeel free to experiment with your favorite types of tea. Most black and green teas mix well into a toddy, but from there it's a personal preference.\nHow Strong Is the Hot Toddy?\nThe hot toddy is not one of those drinks that you down simply to get drunk. It is more of an experience and a way to relax, so its alcohol content may be irrelevant for the most part. However, for the curious drinker, you can expect it to weigh in around 6 percent ABV (12 proof). That's about the same as a high-point beer.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hot-toddy-759692

Each brand offers a different taste?some are spicier, while others are sweeter. The popularity of the Moscow mule has given this brewed beverage a new spotlight, so there are more choices than ever before. If you see an unfamiliar bottle, pick it up and give it a try!\nDuring the apple harvest, take advantage of fresh-pressed cider if you can find it. Many orchards offer it and you can find the unfiltered, cloudy version in a number of produce markets during the fall season. If you like a project, try making your own apple cider at home. It's a great way to use up excess apples.\nPrevent your apple garnish from turning brown by dipping it in a little lime juice after cutting it. Lemon juice is typically recommended, but since you're adding lime to the drink anyway, it will work just fine.\nRecipe Variations\nOn chilly days, serve the apple cinnamon mule warm. It's easy to do on the stovetop or in the microwave?follow the tips for the Christmas Mule?and the ginger beer really comes to life under the heat.\nAdd an extra dimension of flavor to this cocktail by infusing the vodka with complementary flavors.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSince there's no ice involved, be sure to chill the ingredients before mixing this drink. Place the bottles in the refrigerator at least 1 to 2 hours before preparing.\nChampagne cocktails do not require the absolute best wine, which is particularly true when paired with a heavy flavor such as cranberry, so feel free to be a little frugal. There are many great budget-friendly Champagnes available that are perfect for cocktails. \nSparkling wines like cava and prosecco are fantastic substitutes for Champagne, and they're often more reasonably priced.\nWhen it comes to the orange liqueur, however, it is best to buy a high-quality bottle. Recommended brands are Cointreau, Combier, and the brandy-based Grand Marnier (which will give the drink a darker profile).\nQuick Party Service\nJust like any other Champagne cocktail, the poinsettia is best when the wine is added just before serving. There are 2 ways you can make party service a breeze:\nLine up the flutes, then pour and mix the orange liqueur and cranberry juice before the party gets started. When it's time to serve, top each glass with Champagne and hand guests a fresh, sparkling drink.\nMix the liqueur and juice in a serving pitcher and keep it in the refrigerator so it stays cold. As each guest arrives for their cocktail, pour the cranberry mixture and then top it off with sparkling wine.\nRecipe Variations\nPlay down the cranberry a little if you like: Instead of equal parts, pour 2 ounces of cranberry juice and 4 ounces of Champagne.\nMake a virgin poinsettia without the alcohol: Fill a flute halfway with cranberry juice, top it with nonalcoholic sparkling grape juice, and twist an orange zest over the drink before dropping it into the glass.\nFor a pomegranate poinsettia, add pomegranate liqueur and a little orange juice. Another option is to simply substitute the cranberry juice with pomegranate juice or liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a Poinsettia Cocktail?\nThe poinsettia is a great party drink because it's light on the alcohol. Such a long pour of cranberry juice dilutes the wine down to 8 percent ABV (16 proof), ensuring the cocktail falls right between beer and wine.\nWhat's the Difference Between Cranberry Juice and Cranberry Cocktail?\nCranberry juice is actually a blend of different types of fruit juice, often including apple and grape, which helps to add sweetness and mellow out the tartness. Cranberry cocktail, on the other hand, is made only of cranberries; sugar, and sometimes corn syrup, is added for sweetness.\n11 Traditional Christmas Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/poinsettia-cocktail-recipe-759772

Stir in the raw sugar until it is completely dissolved.\nFill a coffee mug with the chai tea and Irish cream.\nStir with a cinnamon stick, then leave it as a garnish. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you are familiar with masala chai, you will know that milk and sugar are often added during the brewing process. However, when making this swizzle drink you're already adding cream (Baileys) and sugar so this seems like overkill. Therefore, it's best to either compile your own chai spice blend or use a prepared chai tea bag and brew that, holding the milk and sugar\nYou can try the drink both ways to see which you like best. The full milk-sugar brewing of the chai does make a very rich autumn chai swizzle and it will likely be too much for many tastes.\nRaw sugar looks like brown sugar, but it has a lighter, natural molasses flavor and coarser texture. It's also called turbinado, muscovado, or demerara sugar.\nRecipe Variations\nChai is not the only tea that works with Baileys. Use the Irish cream to gently spike any cup of tea you're brewing. It's also a really nice creamer option for coffee.\nWant to give your chai an extra kick? Add half a shot (about 1 ounce) of brandy, rum, or whiskey to this recipe.\nRaw sugar is not a requirement, though it is a really nice fit for chai's spice blend. Use your favorite tea sweetener, whether that be agave nectar, honey, white sugar, simple syrup, or a sugar alternative like Stevia.\nHow Strong Is an Autumn Chai Swizzle?\nBaileys is a light liqueur that's bottled at just 34 proof. When mixed into the autumn chai swizzle, the resulting cup of tea will have an alcohol content of just 7 percent ABV (14 proof). That's not a significant strength, but it is stronger than adding just a splash of Irish cream as many people do in their coffee. Just keep in mind that it's about the same as drinking a strong beer.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/autumn-chai-swizzle-759551

However, if you like red wines that are sweet and would like a sweet mulled wine, feel free to choose one that's on the sweet side.\nHow to Store Mulled Wine\nYou can keep mulled wine in the refrigerator 3 to 4 days after you make it. Just cool it to room temperature and transfer it to an airtight container.\nWhen it's time to serve the wine again, transfer to a saucepan and reheat over medium-low heat. It will still be good, but the flavors may not be as vibrant. The same procedure would be followed if you wanted to make the wine ahead of time and then reheat it.\nYou can also freeze leftover grzaniec if you like, but alcohol doesn't freeze completely solid.

Repeat with the other half.\nServe in glasses with nutmeg sprinkled on top. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe amount of vanilla extract seems like a lot compared to most recipes that use the ingredient. However, it is key to giving this eggnog the extra flavor it needs to be delicious.\nIf possible, use pure vanilla extract rather than the imitation variety.\nTurbinado is a type of raw sugar that adds to the eggnog\'s character as well. You can find it with other sugars at most grocers. It might also be labeled as demerara or simply ""raw.""\nAdding a cinnamon stick to each glass is a simple garnish that also infuses a little flavor into the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nUse your favorite sweetener for this recipe. Substitute light brown sugar and other granular sugars equally for the turbinado. Or, use 1/2 cup of liquid sweeteners like honey, agave nectar, or simple syrup.\nYou can also use a flavored syrup to add more dimension to the eggnog. For instance, the toffee syrup used in this toffee eggnog can easily be made vegan by using a butter and cream substitute. A brown sugar spiced syrup will add some of the season\'s favorite spices as well.\nMake this eggnog nonalcoholic by skipping the rum or brandy. If you want to give guests the option, add a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of either liquor to the individual serving glasses, top it with the eggnog, then give it a good stir.\nHow to Store\nThis vegan eggnog should be stored in the refrigerator and used within three to five days. \nCan this eggnog be aged?\nThe point of aged eggnog is to let the eggy taste subside and the flavor to develop while allowing the booze to kill any potential bacteria. In this vegan recipe, this is not necessary because it doesn\'t include raw eggs.\nHow Strong Is Vegan Eggnog?\nThis eggnog is delightfully light when made with an 80-proof rum or brandy. It\'s only an estimate because there are many factors involved in this recipe, but it should weigh in somewhere around 4 percent ABV (8 proof).

Since the punch includes soda, the still wine is a great choice unless you want to double up on the bubbles.\nDepending on what\'s easiest at the moment, use either fresh or frozen blueberries. This recipe originally recommended ""1 bag frozen blueberries"" which doesn\'t clearly define the amount. About 1 cup of the fruit is perfect, but, by all means, add more if you like!\nFrozen pink lemonade is a concentrate that\'s typically mixed with about 64 ounces of water. This recipe uses the wine as a substitute for the water.\nThe lemonade should thaw rather quickly but would be best if you set it out for a little bit to make it easier to stir into the punch. None the less, the punch will need to be stirred again when you take it out of the fridge.\nIf you prefer to avoid the frozen pink lemonade (or it\'s unavailable near you), use about 32 ounces of pink lemonade that\'s already made. You can even make your own pink lemonade by sweetening fresh-squeezed lemonade with strawberry simple syrup.\nAdd less soda and lemonade to suit your taste and the lemonade you\'re using.\nAs written, the recipe should yield around 10 6-ounce servings.

Mix to combine. If you feel it needs more sugar, you can add some sugar now but be sure to mix well.\nServe over ice.\nUsing fully ripe strawberries will give you the most strawberry flavor. When shopping for strawberries, the small, deep purple berries are the best choice rather than the giant, often-flavorless ones. Save those big ones for a garnish for your pitcher of sangria or dip them in chocolate to serve alongside the sangria.\nSangria is usually sweetened, but you can vary the amount of sugar to your taste. You can also use plain sparkling soda water rather than lemon-lime soda if you prefer. To lower the calories, you can use a diet soda or plain soda water, reduce the sugar, and reduce the vodka.\nSangria probably takes its name from the Spanish word for blood, sangre. Nobody has pinpointed when sangria was first made, but it became common in the 18th century in Spain. Today, you will find sangria served at restaurants, bars, and homes throughout Spain. In the European Union, only sangria made in Spain and Portugal is allowed to be sold as sangria.

It also doubles as a stir stick.\nRecipe Variations\nAdd cinnamon, nutmeg or cloves to give this drink some autumn spice flavors. You can add these to the cider while heating it up. Strain out the spices before making the drink.\nTuaca is unique among vanilla liqueurs and many others, such as Galliano, also have their own herbal blends behind the vanilla flavor. Not every one will work out, but try other vanilla liqueurs in the hot apple pie to see what you think.\nVanilla-flavored vodka and butterscotch liqueur are good substitutes for Tuaca as well.\nGive this drink a boost with an extra shot of liquor. Good choices are rye or bourbon whiskeys and aged or dark rums. For an additional hint of fruit, try pear brandy.\nYou can easily make a nonalcoholic variation for younger family members or those who prefer not to drink. Simply replace the alcohol with a few drops of vanilla extract or make a vanilla simple syrup to sweeten the cider.\nHow Strong Is a Hot Apple Pie?\nYou can make this drink as strong as you like, it's all going to depend on how much cider you pour.

If you're going to use a substitute for Belvedere, make sure it's of equal quality.\nFor the lime juice, simply cut a lime wedge and squeeze it into the shaker. You want just a splash of juice as too much will throw the drink out of balance.\nHomemade Vanilla Liqueur\nIt's pretty easy to make a vanilla liqueur, even if it's your first attempt at any homemade liqueur. Essentially, you'll use a vanilla syrup to sweeten the liquor of your choice. It's a relatively quick process and can be adapted to suit your taste.\nTo make the liqueur, begin by making vanilla syrup. Dissolve 2 cups of sugar into 1 cup of boiling water. Add a whole vanilla bean (split lengthwise) and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let it steep for about 8 hours before removing the bean. Alternatively, you can add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the syrup, eliminating the long steeping time.\nWith the syrup ready, choose your liquor; brandy and vodka are great choices. For a full 750ml bottle of liquor, begin by adding 1/4 cup of vanilla syrup and mix it. Taste the liqueur and add more syrup (a little at a time) until it reaches your desired flavor. Bottle and store just like any other liqueur.\nHow Strong Is a Vanilla Martini?\nThe average vanilla liqueur is bottled around 60 proof, so that's a good strength to use when estimating the drink's alcohol content. When mixed with an 80-proof vodka, the martini should fall into the 29 percent ABV (58 proof) range. That's perfectly normal for liquor-only martinis.

It all depends on how much soda and whiskey you pour.\nFor example, if you pour an 80-proof whiskey and follow the recipe as given, your drink would have an alcohol content of about 9 percent ABV (18 proof). Then again, if you double up on the whiskey, opt for a high-proof whiskey, or pour less ginger ale, the drink can almost double to 18 percent ABV. \nWhy Is It Called a Highball?\nCocktail origin stories are sometimes difficult to sort out, and the highball falls into that category. The drink emerged in the late 1890s, and several sources indicate that bartenders in England called whiskey drinks ""balls,"" and tall or ""high"" glasses were used for such drinks. Another theory says the name comes from a 19th-century railroad signal. When the ball was high or raised on the signal post, the train could pass through without stopping. In ""The Joy of Mixology,"" Gary Regan writes that the drink mimics the train signal that it was time to go: two short whistles followed by one long one, as the drink consists of 2 ounces of whiskey and a long pour of ginger ale or soda.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-highball-cocktail-recipe-761448

One that you wouldn\'t mind in your vodka tonic should do just fine.\nSave those frozen strawberries for your next strawberry daiquiri and go with fresh berries for the Christmas Jones whenever possible. This is not the average blended cocktail because there is no ice added to the blender. Instead, it is more of a spiked fruit puree or a blended juice and that would warrant the freshest fruits possible.\nIf you have a juicer, do yourself a favor and use fresh pineapple juice because the drink will be just a little brighter.\nIf you\'re using bottled pineapple juice, you may find that the little cans of pineapple juice are the best option. They usually come in 5- to 6-ounce cans, which is perfect for a single round of drinks and you don\'t have to worry about wasting a larger can.\nFor the best drink, choose a juice that is ""Not From Concentrate."" Keep an eye on the expiration dates, too, as they can easily be pushed to the back of the refrigerator and forgotten.\nHow Strong Is a Christmas Jones?\nThis recipe is exceptionally light on the alcohol. Despite the fact that the recipe creates two highball drinks, there is only a single shot of vodka used. With an 80-proof vodka and a final volume of 8 ounces in each glass, the Christmas Jones would weigh in at a very mild 3 percent ABV (6 proof).

Choose something you wouldn't mind drinking straight to create a good foundation for the cocktail. Blanco tequilas are a good choice.\nAny apple schnapps will work as a substitute for Apple Pucker. If you want a more relaxed apple flavor that's not as tart, try something like Berentzen Apple Liqueur.\nHomemade sour mix takes about 20 minutes to make and it's easy. If you have simple syrup, simply add equal parts lemon and lime juices to taste. You can also make the citrus-flavored syrup on the stovetop or in your cocktail shaker.\nWhenever you're garnishing with an apple slice, dip it into lemon juice immediately after cutting it. This will halt the oxidation process that's responsible for the fruit's flesh turning brown, which doesn't look very appealing.\nRecipe Variation\nTo make a shaken apple margarita, simply pour the tequila, apple liqueur and juice, and sour mix into a cocktail shaker. Give it a really good shake, then strain into the prepared glass over fresh ice.\nHow Strong Is an Apple Margarita?\nThe frozen apple margarita is a very light cocktail. When made with Apple Pucker and an 80-proof tequila, it blends up to a mild 7 percent ABV (14 proof). If you opt for the shaken version, the alcohol content doubles to about 14 percent ABV (28 proof).

You really cannot go wrong with any of the choices and you can have a lot of fun playing around with different brands for each.\nOne of the better combinations we've found is Sandeman's 10 Year Old Port (actually a tawny port, though they make a great ruby as well) with fresh-squeezed orange juice, Korbel Brandy, and Moet & Chandon Imperial Brut Champagne. However, we really have yet to find a bad combination because this is simply a great cocktail no matter what you pour.\nThis is also a fantastic drink that can fit into any budget. There are great options in every price range for the brandy, ruby port, and Champagne. You can spend as much or as little as you like and have a fantastic drink to serve guests.\nA Primer on Port Wines\nMost of us are very familiar with everything in the happy New Year recipe. The one exception may be the ruby port. Like vermouth, ports are a style of fortified wine though ports have a much more pronounced fruit taste as opposed to the botanical profile of vermouth. This is, for the most part, because they are fortified with brandy before aging.\nThere are distinct styles of port and they are either wood-aged or bottle-aged. Ruby port is considered the introductory port wine. It is younger, less expensive, and used most often when a port is called for in cocktails. Other styles include tawny, vintage, and white port.\nHow Strong Is the Happy New Year?\nThis is a very difficult question to answer because there are so many options available for each alcoholic beverage that go into the cocktail. To get a general sense of the drink's strength, we will use some averages.\n\nLet's say that we mix the cocktail with a 40 percent ABV brandy, a 12 percent ABV Champagne, and a 19.5 percent ABV port. With these, we can estimate that this cocktail is about 17 percent ABV (34 proof). It is a relatively light cocktail and about what we would expect from a wine drink.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/happy-new-year-cocktail-recipe-759437

There are just two ingredients, so each is very important and any impurities in either spirit will definitely come through.\n\nThe best godmother will come from a top-shelf vodka. Any of the fantastic craft vodkas available on the market today are excellent choices as well. It doesn't have to be your best vodka, just something that's smooth and has a clean taste.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the godmother cannot be a drink for the frugal drinker. It's actually a fantastic choice when money's a little tight. The key to making it just as tasty as any top-shelf vodka is to be selective on which cheaper vodka you buy. There are a number of budget-friendly vodka brands available that are almost as smooth as any premium brand. Choose wisely and you'll have a great drink.\nChoose Your Amaretto\nFor the best godmother, don't discount your amaretto, either. This is one of the liqueurs that is essential to a well-stocked bar and you'll find it useful in a variety of cocktails and mixed drinks. Since it is so important, there's no need to skimp on quality. This is especially true for the godmother because the amaretto is the primary flavoring ingredient of the drink.\n\nYou will find bottles of amaretto at the store for $10 or less. As with many liqueurs in that price range, these tend to be very syrupy and leave a lot to be desired in the taste department. If you really want great tasting drinks, spend a little more on a premium amaretto such as Disarrono, Lazzaroni, Luxardo, or Marie Brizard. Since amaretto is rarely poured over an ounce, you'll find that it lasts quite a while and that the taste is worth the extra cost.\n\nOf course, if you're the crafty kind, you can make your own amaretto. It requires just a few common ingredients and very little time. The godmother just happens to be one of the best drinks to show off the fruits of your labor as well.\nHow Strong Is the Godmother?\nMost vodka is bottled at 80-proof and amaretto varies from brand to brand. We'll use the middle ground and go with a 50-proof amaretto for this example. With those two assumptions, we can estimate that the average godmother has an alcohol content around 29 percent ABV (58 proof). \n\nThis is not the weakest cocktail you can make and it is comparable to the popular white Russian. If you're looking for a not-so-creamy alternative to that favorite, the godmother is a perfect choice.\nBartending 101: Essential Techniques, Tips, and Tricks""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/godmother-cocktail-recipe-761065

That theory may work when helping you make a better bloody Mary, but the majority of drinkers shoot a prairie fire for two reasons: to get drunk and see how much heat they can take. However, if you want any taste buds or feeling left on your tongue at the end of the night, it really is best to take it easy.\nYou will also want to have something available to cool your mouth down. Water may not douse the heat, so try biting into a lime or eating something like a tortilla chip or piece of bread to find relief.\nRecipe Variations\nQuite often, the tequila in the prairie fire is replaced with another liquor. For instance, the Canadian prairie fire uses Yukon Jack and the Caribbean prairie fire pours rum (often 151-proof). In reality, you can add Tabasco to anything, from vodka to whiskey to whatever you have left in the liquor cabinet.\nHow Strong Is the Prairie Fire?\nThe daring nature of these shots goes beyond the hot sauce because they are anything but weak. When it comes to the alcohol content of the prairie fire family of shots, you're essentially drinking the equivalent of the bottling strength of the base liquor?the tequila, whiskey, or whatever. For instance, the prairie fire is about 37 percent ABV (74 proof). This can be dangerous territory and quickly lead to extreme drunkenness or alcohol poisoning if you're not careful.

The solution is to strain it into a rocks glass or create two shorter shots and share it with a friend.\nRecipe Variations\nAs it often goes with drinks that have long-standing popularity, there are a number of ways to make the Alabama slammer. Try one of these versions instead, they\'re all made the same way: shake it, strain it, and shoot it.\nMix 1 ounce each amaretto and Southern Comfort with 1/2 ounce each lime juice and grenadine.\nMix 1/2 ounce sloe gin with 1 ounce each amaretto and Southern Comfort and add a dash of lemon juice.\nMix 1/2 ounce each amaretto, whiskey, orange juice, and creme de noyaux (or amaretto).\nWhy So Many Alabama Slammers?\nThe story goes that the Alabama slammer was created in the 1970s near the University of Alabama. The school colors include crimson, which is the color of this shot. It was an era of sweet, fruity drinks, a number of which included the sloe gin and Southern Comfort found in the Alabama slammer (both of which have also since lost their mass appeal). For one reason or another, people started to switch up this recipe. It seems that the point was not always what was in the shot, but its final color. Maybe one person didn\'t have sloe gin or another had a bottle of whiskey. If it was red and included amaretto, it seemed perfectly logical to call it an Alabama slammer. It\'s also interesting to note that many tall mixed drink versions are yellow because they use more orange and/or pineapple juice. These are also known as yellowhammers, which may be the original name (it\'s also Alabama\'s state bird).\nHow Strong Is an Alabama Slammer?\nThe three liqueurs that make up this Alabama slammer recipe are relatively mild, so the shot is as well. Generally, its alcohol content will be in the 20 percent ABV (40 proof) range. While it\'s not the strongest shot you can mix up, it is half the strength of a straight shot of whiskey.\nWhat Kind of Alcohol Is Southern Comfort?\nSouthern Comfort (or SoCo, for short) is one of those mystery liquors that often confuses drinkers. It\'s familiar and you know how it tastes, but you really don\'t know what it is. It has always looked like whiskey and had flavor nuances of whiskey, but Southern Comfort hasn\'t always included actual whiskey.\n\nThe story began in 1874 when Martin Wilkes Heron added fruits and spices to mask the harsh taste of whiskey he was serving at a New Orleans saloon. It caught on with drinkers and was marketed as Southern Comfort. Though the taste has remained similar, the recipe changed over the years as the brand was bought and sold by large liquor companies. For years, it was made with a neutral grain spirit similar to vodka and (not always) a hint of bourbon. It\'s unclear if it was aged, but it did contain sugar as well, so it was technically a liqueur.\n\nIn 2017, the Sazerac Company purchased the brand and revised the recipe to include real whiskey from their own stock. The recipe remains a secret?the fruit flavor is dominated by apricot, though many drinkers note a peachy taste. The brand cunningly labels it as ""Spirit whiskey with natural flavors and caramel color."" It is definitely not bourbon because it includes additives. Until more is revealed, the best description remains that Southern Comfort is a whiskey-based liqueur flavored with fruits and spices. Beyond the original 70-proof version, it\'s also available in 80-proof and 100-proof bottlings.\nThe Scarlett O\'Hara Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/alabama-slammer-shooter-recipe-759572

If you have any left over, store it in an airtight container for the next time you make this drink.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you have a favorite cinnamon whiskey other than Fireball, it will work great in this recipe. Most of the commercial brands are also sweetened, so there\'s no need to adjust the recipe. These are often lower than 40 percent ABV (80 proof), and you can look for ""liqueur"" on the label.\nYou can also use a homemade cinnamon-infused whiskey. It won\'t be sweetened and works great with bourbon and smooth blended whiskies: Place two whole cinnamon sticks in a large jar filled with the whiskey of your choice and let it infuse for about three days. When the flavor is to your liking, remove the cinnamon.\nWhen using an unsweetened cinnamon whiskey, add about 1/4 to 1/2 ounce of simple syrup or maple syrup to the Fireball eggnog recipe.\nHow Strong Is Fireball Eggnog?\nEggnog is notorious for getting holiday revelers drunk, but this Fireball eggnog isn\'t terribly strong. The standard bottle of Fireball Whisky is just 33 percent ABV (66 proof), which is lighter than the average whiskey, and amaretto is a similar strength. If you keep the eggnog\'s proportions, the drink will shake up to around 12 percent ABV (24 proof), which is similar to a glass of wine. Using Fireball 42 Proof will increase the alcohol content, and you can get tipsy by drinking too much spiked eggnog of any kind.\nDoes Eggnog Curdle With Alcohol?\nThough rare, there is the potential that eggnog will curdle when it\'s mixed with alcohol. That\'s typically due to too much acid interacting with the dairy. This can come from high-proof liquor or milk that\'s either lower in fat or going sour.

Either of the orange blossom cocktails is nice with a London dry gin, but you might like them a bit more with one of the older styles of gin. Those like Plymouth, Old Tom, and genever have an underlying sweetness not found in newer styles and they work very nicely against citrus fruits.\n\nIt is also important to realize that gin is rarely mixed with orange juice. The two just don\'t jive as well as other pairings so you should be a bit pickier on the gin. You might also remember that many of the gins from Crockett\'s time were a bit sweeter than we\'re used to today. Choosing a gin along these lines will help balance out the citrus and produce a more authentic orange blossom.\nThe Orange Juice. This is a delicate pairing and there is no reason for you to muddle it up with the average carton of OJ. While it\'s always recommended, there are certain drinks in which fresh-squeezed juice is almost essential and the orange blossoms fall into this category. \n\nTake the time to juice a few oranges or, at the very least, buy the best, freshest, and purest orange juice you can find. \nOrange Blossom No. 2\nCrockett\'s recipe for the orange blossom no. 2 (also known as the Adirondack) excludes sweet vermouth. It is built in a ""bar glass"" and an old-fashioned will work perfectly. It definitely has more of a Screwdriver feel but has a slightly higher concentration of alcohol.\n\nTo make the drink, simply pour 2 ounces each of gin and orange juice over ice.\nHow Strong Are These Orange Blossom Cocktails?\nCompared to other classic cocktails like the martini, these orange blossoms are quite light. This is due to the orange juice that made the occasional appearance in drinks of the era. \n\nWith an 80-proof gin, we can estimate the alcohol content of these two drinks:\nOrange Blossom: 15 percent ABV (30 proof)\nOrange Blossom No. 2: 17 percent ABV (34 proof)\nHelpful Links\nHow to Stir a Cocktail Like the Pros\nBartending Tips for Better Drinks\nHow to Stock Your Home Bar']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/orange-blossom-cocktail-recipe-759756

Watch strawberry mixture oozing its way to the top along the sides of the glass, creating a flowing lava effect. Garnish with a pineapple wedge and paper umbrella, if desired.\nColorful Lavas\nBy switching out a few ingredients, you can make other colorful lavas. Blend the rum with these options, then top it with the white mix.\nYellow lava: Use 3 ounces of fresh or frozen mango, pineapple, or frozen orange juice. Decorate with a chunk of fresh mango.\nGreen lava: Juice 4 leaves of kale, 1 stalk of celery, and 1 green apple to obtain a green mixture. Add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar if the juice is too tart. Decorate with a wedge of lime or a slice of green apple and a mint sprig.\nPurple lava: Use 3 ounces of fresh or frozen blueberries or blackberries, or a mixture of both. Decorate with a few big blueberries speared on a cocktail toothpick.\nOrange lava: Use 3 ounces of carrot extract to mix with the rums. Decorate with an orange slice.\nHow Strong Is a Lava Flow Cocktail?\nThe ice, fruits, and mixers tend to make frozen cocktails rather light. Though it's just an estimate, the lava flow is a low-proof drink, weighing in around 5 percent ABV (10 proof). It's similar to the average beer, but this drink is far more delicious.\nHow Do You Make a Virgin Lava Flow?\nFor a mocktail version, skip the rum, and you'll have a fun and delicious drink minus the booze. Blend the strawberries into a pur?e or add about 1/2 cup of water or coconut water for a thick, syrupy consistency. Alternatively, make a virgin Miami vice; the only additional ingredients are half and half, lime juice, and simple syrup.\nWhat's the Difference Between Coconut Cream and Cream of Coconut?\nCoconut cream is a high-fat, unsweetened cream that has less water than coconut milk. It is often used as a thickener in food recipes. Cream of coconut is much sweeter and richer, which is why it's often used in cocktails like the pi?a colada. While lava flow recipes often use coconut cream, you can use cream of coconut to make a sweeter drink.\nBest Blended Cocktails to Enjoy This Summer""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lava-flow-recipe-hawaiian-tropical-drink-recipe-1532784

Enjoy!\nWhat is sambuca?\nSambuca is a traditional Italian liqueur predominantly flavored with anise or aniseed, along with other herbs and spices. Each brand of sambuca has its own, and often secret, recipe. and while all sambucas have the same general flavor profile, there are subtle differences.\nSambuca can be drunk straight, like in this recipe, either at room temperature or slightly chilled. It is also commonly used in a variety of cocktails and shooters, like the B-53. If you come across a cocktail recipe that simply states ""anise liqueur,"" sambuca is one of your best options to use.\nSambuca comes in three colors: white (clear), red, and black (more of a deep purple or blue). Popular brands include Molinari, Romano, Luxardo, Galliano, Sambuca di Amore, Opal Nera, and Zambello.\nWhat Is caff? corretto?\nCaff? corretto is another popular Italian drink that showcases liquor and coffee in a single cup. It means ""corrected coffee\'""and is as simple as adding a drizzle of sambuca, grappa, or brandy to a freshly made espresso. However, if you\'re ordering a caff? corretto in Italy, be sure to specify the liquor, saying either un caff? corretto alla grappa or un caff? corretto alla sambuca.\nHow Strong Is a Coffee Sambuca?\nMost sambuca has an alcohol content of 42 percent ABV (84 proof). It is not a light liqueur and is slightly stronger than the average vodka. Two ounces of sambuca thus have 42 percent ABV.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/coffee-sambuca-recipe-766146

In celebration of a couple\'s engagement, the bartender mixed up this drink and told them to name it, which they did after their yellow-colored car parked outside.\nRecipe Variation\nIf the cream is too heavy for you, use half-and-half instead. It\'s the perfect balance between thick cream and thin milk and is an excellent choice for many dairy cocktails.\nTips\nCr?me de cacao is a sweet chocolate-flavored liqueur that comes in two varieties: dark (brown) and white (clear). While they generally taste the same (and can be used interchangeably), the liqueurs\' colors will alter the look of the drink. In order to keep your Cadillac ""golden,"" go with the white option so the brown doesn\'t compete with Galliano\'s yellow color.\nAs with any cream-based cocktail, make sure your dairy products are fresh. Check the expiration date and give it a sniff test. If it smells off, it will ruin the drink and waste your liqueur.\nRich cocktails are much better when served as cold as possible. The easiest way to ensure your Golden Cadillac stays cold from the first sip to the last is to use a well-chilled glass. If you\'re serving it after dinner, stick your cocktail glasses in the freezer while you eat, and they\'ll be nice and frosty when it\'s time for dessert.\nHow Strong Is a Golden Cadillac?\nBoth of the liqueurs that are used in the Golden Cadillac are relatively light. When combined, they create a low-proof cocktail that is perfect for an after-dinner drink. On average, it has an alcohol content of around 13 percent alcohol by volume (26 proof).\n17 Dessert Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/golden-cadillac-recipe-759301

For a single shot, cut all of the ingredients in half or pour it into a larger glass.\nCrown Royal makes a number of Canadian whisky expressions. The ""Deluxe"" bottle is the flagship, and the original whisky produced by the brand. It\'s the one you\'ll most likely want to use for the shot because it\'s the least expensive. They do make affordable flavored versions as well; the apple, peach, and vanilla would be tasty in the red snapper.\nRecipe Variations\nThis recipe can also be served as a tall, refreshing highball drink. Crown Royal recommends pouring a 1 1/4-ounce shot of whisky, 1/4 ounce of amaretto, and 6 ounces of cranberry juice. Adjust this to suit your taste?a full 1 1/2-ounce shot of both spirits makes a fine drink?and serve it over ice.\nMake it a sparkling drink by splitting the cranberry juice with lemon-lime soda. Sprite is a favorite pairing for Crown Royal, and it\'s also nice with the amaretto-cranberry juice combo.\nAnother popular and similar Crown Royal-based drink is called the royal flush. The recipe pours a shot of the whisky with 1/4 ounce of peach schnapps and 3 ounces of cranberry juice. While it\'s often served on the rocks, you can also serve it as a shot.\nSimilarly, the fuzzy J?ger cranberry shot pours peach schnapps and cranberry juice, though that recipe uses J?germeister as the base.\nHow Strong Is a Red Snapper Shot?\nThis is not the strongest shot you can mix up. In fact, it\'s surprisingly light and that\'s due to all the cranberry juice. Its alcohol content will be around 14 percent ABV (28 proof), or about the same as a strong whiskey and Coke.

It\'s just like any other berry-flavored simple syrup recipe; for 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar, use 1/2 to 1 cup of raspberries (fresh or frozen). You will want to strain it well to remove as many of the berry\'s tiny seeds as possible.\nFresh lemon juice is highly recommended in this recipe.

Give your egg a quick test by placing it in a glass of water; if it sinks, it\'s fresh and good to use in drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nYou might want to switch to simple syrup and skip the sugar.

Some of the brands include Sangster's Original Jamaica Rum Cream and El Dorado Rum Cream. Rumchata makes a fine substitute if you cannot find either of those.\nKahlua and most other coffee liqueurs are good alternatives to Tia Maria.\nFor the 151 rum, Cruzan, Don Q, and Goslings are good options and each should be relatively easy to find. Bacardi 151 Rum has been discontinued; don't fall for those insanely priced bottles ($100 or more) that are still being sold online. It's not worth the price when the other brands sell for around $20!\nAs you switch brands of the liquors, you may notice that some do not layer as well as others. Though they're generally pretty equal, not every spirit in a category will have the same specific gravity that's required to float on top of the liquor beneath it.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, pour an 80-proof rum in this shot. It should float just as well on the cream layer, will make it taste considerably smoother, and will not be as potent (about 25 percent ABV or 50 proof).\nDon't feel like layering tonight? Toss the ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice and shake it up. It will taste just as good (if not better).\nHow Strong Is a Voodoo Shot?\nThis shot is not mixed, so there's no ice dilution that will knock down the strength.

In general, you can expect this one to have an alcohol content around 38 percent ABV (76 proof), which is just a little weaker than a straight shot of 80-proof rum.\nBirthday Cake Shot""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/voodoo-shooter-recipe-759845

It's available at most grocery stores and, if you have baked goods to frost as well, you can make your own whipped frosting.\nOne quick dunk will grab a lot of sprinkles. Go slow if you want more frosting and fewer sprinkles.\nCr?me de cacao is available in two styles: dark and white (clear). Either works well in this shot, and only the color will change. You can also use any chocolate liqueur you have on hand.\nRecipe Variations\nThis drink also makes a fabulous cocktail. Shake it up and strain it into a cocktail glass for a dessert martini or serve it on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass.\nWhipped cream and vanilla vodkas are excellent substitutes for cake vodka and will retain some of the sweetness. You can also pour an unflavored vodka.\nUse any small cake decoration; colored sugars are fun, as are mini pearls.\nSwitch to a chocolate frosting to play up that flavor in the shot.

Hendrick's, G'Vine, and Aviation are among the top choices because of their lighter, unique flavors that pair perfectly with the sweet strawberries.\nFresh lime juice is highly recommended. The average lime yields enough juice, so you can simply squeeze half a lime into the glass. When limes are small, squeeze the entire lime.\nIf you prefer to buy, a number of companies make strawberry syrup. DaVinci, Monin, and Torani are some of the best-known brands and are relatively easy to find.\nWhen pouring the tonic, go slow! It's already very fizzy soda water and it foams up quickly when it touches certain fruits, including strawberries. Your glass will overflow if you're not careful.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch out the syrup with any other fruit-flavored syrup to create your own custom spin on the gin and tonic.\nPour vodka if you prefer for a fruity twist on the vodka tonic.\nAs an alternative to the syrup, muddle a few strawberries in the bottom of your glass, then add the gin, tonic, and bitters. This will create a drier drink sweetened only by the strawberries.\nYou can also make a strawberry infusion with your favorite gin and skip the syrup. It requires about 1 1/2 cups of sliced strawberries for one bottle of gin and will take between five days and two weeks to reach the desired flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Gin and Tonic?\nThe strawberry gin and tonic is a delightfully gentle cocktail. Its alcohol content falls right in line with other soda highballs, around 8 percent ABV (16 proof).

Serve sangria over ice and garnish with additional slices of orange, lime, and fresh mint, if desired.\nTips\nSome sangria aficionados recommend refrigerating your cocktail mix up to 4 hours if you're including chunks of fruit.

But if you don't have time to squeeze your own oranges, pineapples and lemons, you can certainly purchase your juices ready-made from the market without sacrificing too much quality. \nIf you add carbonated water or club soda, do it at the last minute before serving and give the sangria just a quick, brief stir.

For this variation, pour 1 1/2 ounces tequila and 1 ounce of the syrup. Keep the other ingredients the same.\nAnother option with unflavored tequila is to muddle a fresh prickly pear in the cocktail shaker before adding the other ingredients. You'll want to fine strain this drink?use your regular cocktail strainer while pouring through a fine mesh strainer?to catch all those pesky seeds.\nFinally, you can pour a prickly pear-flavored distilled spirit instead of the syrup. These are rare, but distilleries like the Texas Moonshine Company offer it. Apparently, the taste of this one is reminiscent of tequila, so you could even pour the Texas Prickly Pear Cactus Spirit instead of tequila.\nHow Strong Is a Prickly Pear Margarita?\nAs with most shaken margaritas, don't expect this one to be a light drink.

Secure one end of the peel over the lip of the glass.\nFill the glass with ice cubes.\nPour in the bourbon and top with ginger ale.\nAdd a few dashes of bitters.\nStir well. Serve and enjoy.\nGetting the Longest Lemon Peel\nThe most challenging cocktail garnish you can create is the citrus twist. With some practice and the right tools, it shouldn\'t take long to get a hang of the technique and produce clean twists that are 2 to 3 inches long.\nHowever, for the Horse\'s Neck, the idea is to go even longer. A twist that is cut from the entire lemon is the ultimate goal. This will give you the length needed to reach the bottom of a tall glass and maximize the zest\'s infusion into the drink.\nThe best way to achieve this is to use a channel knife. Begin at one end of the lemon and, with a steady hand and fluid motion, work your way around the fruit until you reach the other end. If the peel breaks midway, use it and try again when making the next round. \nIt\'s very likely that you will not get perfectly long spirals right away, so don\'t get frustrated. You will also sacrifice quite a few lemons in the process, but they can still be used for fresh juice. If you\'re determined and patient, the perfect spirals will come to you.\nCreate a Horse\'s Neck With a Kick\nPut an interesting twist on this drink, and try the Horse\'s Neck With a Kick recipe. It includes everything found in the original recipe, but it switches from ginger ale to ginger beer and uses high-proof bourbon.\nThis spicier option and the stronger are where the ""kick"" comes from. It\'s a great drink as well?a bit like a whiskey Moscow Mule?and good for those times when you\'re feeling bold.\nHow Strong Is the Horse\'s Neck?\nEvery Horse\'s Neck is going to be a little different. You may choose a high-proof whiskey or use less soda and both of those changes will make the drink a little stronger. Yet, it is a relatively mild cocktail (perfect for happy hour) either way. If you pour this drink with an 80-proof bourbon and about 6 ounces of ginger ale, the Horse\'s Neck would have an alcohol content around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).\nMargarita Mocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/horses-neck-recipe-759307

Since the drink doesn't have strong flavors, it's best to choose one that you enjoy drinking straight. There's no need to spend a lot of money, but a good mid-range tequila will shine in this mix.\nIt's definitely worth your time to make fresh sour mix, especially if you mix up margaritas regularly.

If you think you\'d like a little more flavor, allow the infusion to continue, checking it daily until it reaches your ideal taste. There may be a point where you want to remove the cinnamon and allow the apples to continue infusing to accentuate that flavor.\nOnce the flavor is to your liking, strain out the apples and cinnamon sticks.\nPour the tequila into a bottle or jar, seal, and use in the cranberry margarita or other cocktails. Store as you would any other liquor.\nMake the Cranberry Margarita\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a cocktail shaker, combine infused tequila, triple sec, cranberry juice, and lime juice. Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled margarita or cocktail glass.\nGarnish with an apple wedge or lime twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou can serve this margarita as an ""up"" cocktail or on the rocks. It\'s also fun with a cinnamon-sugar rim on the glass.\nWhenever you use an apple for a garnish, dip it in lemon juice as soon as it\'s cut. This will prevent it from turning brown as the fruit\'s flesh hits the oxygen in the air.\nWhich Tequila and Apples Are Best for the Infusion?\nFor the tequila, a blanco (silver) tequila is nice, but a reposado tequila is even better. The tequila\'s slight oakiness from aging and earthy agave flavors are perfect for the apple-cinnamon flavors. You\'ll find that red apples are the better choice here. Any of the green varieties are just a little too tart for the intended warm and cozy flavor of this seasonal infusion. Save those for your summer vodka and gin infusions and use red apples for flavoring tequila, whiskey, brandy, and rum.\nRecipe Variation\nThe apple and cinnamon flavors really do make this cranberry margarita unique and give the cocktail dimension. If you don\'t have a week to wait for the tequila infusion, there is a faster way to get those flavors into the drink. The trick is to make an apple-cinnamon simple syrup.\nWhile you could use fresh apples, the quickest way to get a great apple flavor is to split the syrup\'s water with apple juice or cider. Using this cinnamon syrup recipe, simply use 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup apple juice. It can be ready within a couple of hours, and you\'ll be all set to mix up your margarita.\nWhen using the syrup shortcut, you will find it best to adjust the cranberry margarita\'s sweetener, which is the triple sec. Knock the triple sec pour down to 1/4 ounce, add 1/2 ounce of apple-cinnamon syrup, and ramp up the lime juice to just under 3/4 ounce. This drink should have a nice balance of flavor and you can always adjust it further to suit your taste.\nHow Strong Is the Cranberry Margarita?\nAssuming you use an 80-proof tequila and a 30-proof triple sec, the cranberry margarita is relatively mild. That\'s due in part to the generous amount of cranberry juice used in the drink. On average, we can say that it weighs in at around 21 percent ABV (42 proof). It\'s the typical strength of most margaritas.\nMargarita Mocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cranberry-margarita-with-apple-cinnamon-tequila-4148268

Stir well for at least 30 seconds.\nTop the margarita with seltzer or club soda.\nGarnish with a lime wedge.\nTips\nFresh-squeezed juices are essential to making the best non-alcoholic margarita. The bottled versions simply don't have the same snappy flavor, and many are sweetened or include other ingredients.\nThe margarita mocktail is also excellent when shaken: Pour the juices and agave nectar into a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake for about 10 seconds, then strain into the rimmed glass over fresh ice and add the soda.\nCoarse kosher or sea salt will also work for the rim. Avoid fine-grain salts, especially table salt.\nRecipe Variations\nThe recipe is easy to scale up to make a pitcher of non-alcoholic margaritas. To serve six, for instance, combine 1 1/2 cups of lime juice, 3/4 cup each of lemon and orange juices, and 1/3 cup of agave nectar in a pitcher. Keep the base chilled, then fill the pitcher with ice and top it with 1 1/2 to three cups of soda just before serving.\nMake a frozen non-alcoholic margarita by blending the citrus juices and agave nectar with 1 cup of crushed ice. You can also top it with soda in the glass.\nYou can replace the lime juice with freshly squeezed limeade or lime cordial. Since both are sweetened, skip the agave nectar or add just a small amount.\nSubstitute the agave nectar with 1/2 tablespoon of maple syrup or 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of simple syrup. Superfine sugar is a good option if you shake the drink because the agitation will help it dissolve; use about two tablespoons.\nSwitch to a fruit-flavored seltzer, a sweeter soda like ginger ale, or go for a drier profile with tonic water.\nFor a non-alcoholic strawberry margarita, muddle two sliced strawberries with the sweetener before building the rest of the drink. Try this in the blender, too.\nGet a spicy margarita by muddling a few slices of fresh jalape?o pepper with the agave nectar, then finish making the drink. It's a fun option with a chili powder and salt rim.\nHave fun with the rimming options for a quick flavor twist. Citrus margarita salt is always a hit, as is a blend of Tajin seasoning and salt. Raw sugar adds a deep sweetness that's enjoyable, too.\nVirgin Pi?a Colada Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/margarita-mocktail-recipe-5201293

If too sweet for your taste, add another squeeze of lime juice. If too strong for your liking, add more coconut milk.\nPour into chilled martini glasses and garnish with an additional slice of dragon fruit, lime wheel, or lime zest if desired.\nAbout Dragon Fruit\nDragon fruit is a beautiful fruit grown in Southeast Asia, Mexico, Central and South America, and Israel. The plant is actually a type of cactus, and the fruit comes in three colors: two have pink skin, but with different colored flesh (one white, the other red), while another type is yellow with white flesh. Dragon fruit is low in calories and offers numerous nutrients, including vitamin C, phosphorus, calcium, plus fiber and antioxidants.1 Dragon fruit tastes wonderful?sweet and crunchy, with a flavor that's like a cross between kiwi and pear. Dragon fruit is particularly suited to making drinks, since it is mostly composed of water, making it quick and easy to blend up.\nTip\nNote that we tested this recipe both with and without the coconut milk, and it was delicious both ways.

Place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 day before using.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nStore the Irish cream in the refrigerator when not in use. It should keep for quite a while (possibly up to a month), but be sure to check it for freshness if you have it around for more than a week. Treat it like milk and if it smells sour, toss it!\nBefore serving, give the bottle a good shake as it tends to separate.\nIf you include eggs, it is vital that you store the cream properly and use it rather quickly. The whiskey will act as a preservative, but it will not prevent spoilage if the liqueur is left at room temperature for too long.\nAny bottle will do for storing your homemade Irish cream, you simply need to ensure that it has a tight seal. The recipe will yield around 1 liter (4 1/2 cups, or 18 2-ounce servings). That's a little larger than the average 750 mL liquor bottle.\nIf you're recycling empty liquor bottles, ensure they're thoroughly cleaned and split the liqueur between two bottles.\nBe sure to label the bottles with the date so you know exactly when you made it.\nRecipe Variations\nMany homemade Irish cream fans prefer it without eggs and that is perfectly fine. Your liqueur may not be as thick and creamy, but it will still be delicious. If you are in any way uncomfortable with drinking eggs or are giving your Irish cream as a gift, it would be best to simply pass over that ingredient.\nAdjust the flavorings to suit your taste. Chocolate, coffee, and vanilla are common flavoring ingredients for Irish cream. You can add more of any of these, though its best not to go over 3 tablespoons for each in order to create a balanced flavor.\nThe almond extract is an optional ingredient. It adds a little more flavor, though you could also use an alternative such as coconut extract instead.\nUse this recipe as inspiration for creating other cream liqueurs in any flavor you like. For instance, you can replicate Tequila Rose by using tequila as the base liqueur and switching from chocolate to strawberry syrup?keep the vanilla and almond extracts, but skip the coffee and use up to 4 tablespoons of syrup. Or, keep the chocolate and create a delicious chocolate-strawberry cream liqueur.\nBrandy and rum make a great base for cream liqueurs as well.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Irish Cream?\nThis Irish cream is pleasantly light. Its alcohol content will fall in the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range if you include all of the ingredients and use 80 proof whiskey. That's a little lighter than the commercial brands, which are typically bottled between 30 and 40 proof.\nVanilla Liqueur Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-irish-cream-liqueur-recipe-4119062

Serve and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is Long Island Iced Tea?\nThe five liquors make Long Island iced tea seem like a strong drink, but if you do the math, it\'s not terribly potent compared to other cocktails. When you pour 80-proof liquors, 60-proof triple sec, and top it with 2 ounces of soda, its alcohol content falls in the 16 percent ABV (32 proof) range. That is about the same as a strong rum and Coke and half the strength of a gin martini.\nRecipe Variations\nWhen a drink is this famous, there\'s bound to be many different ways to make it. Some of the most popular variations include:\nShake the liquors and sour mix, strain it into a glass with fresh ice, then top it with cola. This approach adds dilution and creates a mellower flavor that\'s rather pleasant.\nSkip the sour mix and use 1/2 ounce each of simple syrup and fresh-squeezed lemon juice instead.\nTo make it a bit stronger (without going overboard), try 3/4 ounce each of the four liquors (gin, light rum, vodka, and blanco tequila) and 1/2 ounce each of triple sec, lemon juice, and simple syrup (or 1 ounce sour mix for the last two). This version has a total of 3 3/4 ounces of liquor and an alcohol content of 20 percent ABV (40 proof).\n\nThe Long Island also inspired many other ""iced tea"" cocktails over the years. They\'re all made the same way and simply replace an ingredient or two:\nLong Beach iced tea: Contains everything in the Long Island, but the cola is replaced with cranberry juice.\nMiami iced tea: Peach schnapps replaces the tequila, and lemon-lime is the soda of choice.\nHawaiian iced tea: This drink is topped with pineapple juice instead of soda.\nElectric iced tea: Blue cura?ao replaces the triple sec, and the recipe uses lemon-lime soda to create a brilliant blue drink.\nTexas tea: Simply add bourbon to the Long Island for an even more potent mix. Some people mistakenly refer to this as a Long Island, but whiskey is not included in the original (or accepted) recipe.\nWho Created the Long Island Iced Tea?\nThe story of Long Island iced tea is as sordid as its ingredient list, and its true origin may be lost to history. One Prohibition-era story credits Charles Bishop, a 1930s moonshiner in then-dry Tennessee. Jump to the 1970s, and the concoction\'s creation could go to Robert Bott, a bartender from Long Island. Then there is the tale that the Long Island was an original drink of the T.G.I. Friday\'s franchise. It is entirely possible that Bishop made the drink and that it was forgotten for a few decades until Bott remade it and gave it the now-famous name. At some point, the restaurant probably caught wind of it and claimed it as their own (this is not unheard of).\nWine Pairings for Korean Food']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/long-island-iced-tea-and-variations-759315

Wipe a lemon wedge around the glass to wet the surface, then dip it into the sugar. Set aside to dry while you mix the drink.\nIn a cocktail shaker filled with ice, pour the vodka, lemon juice, and simple syrup.\nShake well.\nStrain into the rimmed glass.\nGarnish with a lemon twist. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSimple drinks like this deserve?and almost require?the best ingredients. The foundation is vodka, so begin building the best tasting cocktail possible by choosing a smooth vodka. There are many fantastic premium vodkas perfect for cocktails of this caliber. If your budget is tight, you can also find some nice inexpensive vodkas.\nTo get the absolute best lemon drop, the lemon juice and syrup should both be fresh. One lemon will yield enough juice for one or two drinks, and homemade syrup is easy to make.\nIf you find the drink to be a little too tart, add more syrup next time. Likewise, if it's a bit too sweet for your taste, pour more lemon juice.\nVariations\nAdd extra flavor with citrus or another fruit vodka.\nA fun addition, 1/2 ounce of limoncello gives the lemon drop an extra sweetened lemon flavor.\nFruit syrups are simple to make and berries are a nice pairing for the tart lemon juice.\nFloral syrups can also add a fun twist. For instance, a lavender simple syrup creates a lovely lavender lemon drop martini. In spring, get a similar flavor by harvesting lilac blooms for a lilac lemon drop martini.\nAnother simple variation adds 1/4 ounce Cointreau and uses only 1/2 teaspoon simple syrup. This brings in an orange undertone that complements the sweetened lemon.\nIf you're in the mood for a shot, try the lemon drop shot. It has the same great flavor in an interactive shooter that's quite fun.\nHow to Make Your Own Lemon Drop Martini Mix\nLemon drop martini mixes are, essentially, a lemon sour?sweetened lemon juice in a convenient pour-and-shake package. You can replicate that by making a fresh lemon sour at home: Replace the lime juice in a standard sour mix recipe with lemon juice.\n\nThe advantage of pouring lemon juice and simple syrup separately is that you can adjust the sweet and sour to taste. You can still get that customization in a homemade lemon sour: Take notes while mixing up the martini with the individual ingredients until you find an ideal balance. Use that sweet-sour ratio when making your lemon sour and bottle it. This makes it even easier to enjoy a lemon drop anytime you like because you simply need to add vodka and shake it up.\nHow to Create the Lemon Twist Garnish\nThe lemon twist is one of the trickiest citrus garnishes to cut. It's not difficult, but it does take a little practice.\nUse a canelle knife or sharp paring knife and hold the whole lemon firmly in one hand.\nDig the knife into the peel, just deep enough to avoid most of the white pith.\nIn a smooth motion, roll the fruit in your hand as the knife cuts a thin strip of peel. You can stop whenever it reaches the desired length or when it naturally cuts off.\nRoll the peel into a tight spiral and gently squeeze it without breaking the peel. The twist will loosen up once released; keep it in a glass of ice water to maintain a nice spiral.\nHow Strong Is a Lemon Drop Martini?\nThe lemon drop has an alcohol content that's typical of fruity vodka martinis. On average, it shakes up to about 20 percent ABV (40 proof), which is half the strength of a straight shot of vodka. Keep this in mind because the cocktail's sweet taste makes it easy to drink one too many.\n20 Cheap and Easy Mixed Drinks to Make at Home""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lemon-drop-martini-recipe-759314

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou can also shake this drink. To do so, secure a mixing tin on top of the glass and give the mix a quick shake prior to adding the soda.\nMore Tips for Making a Great John Collins\nBourbon is often preferred for the John Collins though it can be made with other styles of whiskey as well. Canadian, rye, and blended whiskeys are all popular options.\n\nIrish whiskey is another possibility and you will want to be very selective if you want to use Scotch. A good blended Scotch may be best because it is a little more neutral than many of the other brands, particularly single malts.\n\nIn all \'Collins\' drinks, there are two basic options for creating the sour component.\nMake it with fresh lemon juice and simple syrup as in the recipe above.\nReplace those two ingredients with a fresh-made sour mix (or commercial sour that is available at most liquor stores).\n\nTo keep a nice balance in the drink, it really is best to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice. By separating the sweet and sour, you have more control. You\'ll want that, especially as you experiment with whiskeys because you can adjust the two elements to fit the liquor you\'re pouring at the moment.\nHow Strong Is the John Collins?\nEstimating the strength of a highball like the John Collins is difficult because the amount of soda poured is the unknown. On average, 2 ounces of soda is used to fill the glass, though this can be more or less given the bartender\'s pour style and size of the glass.\n\nIf we use an 80-proof whiskey and count on 2 ounces of soda, then the John Collins would have an alcohol content of around 11 percent ABV (22 proof). If you would like it a little weaker or stronger, add more soda or whiskey accordingly.\nExploring the Collins Family\nThere are many \'Collins\' drinks that vary due to the base liquor used and all of them are good drinks to memorize. To remember the difference between the John and Tom Collins, I think of ""John"" as the macho whiskey drinker (also the Jimmy Dean song ""Big Bad John"") and associate ""Tom"" with gin.\n\nThe vodka collins is an easy one to remember because the liquor of choice is right there in the name. Similarly, you can recall that the tequila collins has a tequila base.\n\nThe Collins formula is easy to remember:\n1 1/2 parts Base Liquor\n1 part Sour\n1/2 part Sweet\nTopped with Soda\nServed over ice in a highball glass\n\nOf course, those ratios will change slightly based on the spirit, but this will get you close.\nFrom there, you can add ingredients to any collins recipe to come up with an entirely new drink. For instance, the American Collins add bing cherries and blueberries to the Tom Collins and the Lavender Sapphire Collins opts for a lavender-infused syrup. Come spring, you definitely have to try the Rhubarb Collins featuring a fresh rhubarb syrup against a gin background (though whiskey is fun as well).\n\nTake your collins experience from there. The possibilities are endless and it\'s a ton of fun to see what you can come up with.\nAlmost a Collins Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/john-collins-whiskey-highball-recipe-759714

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSome drinkers prefer a lemon twist garnish, though the rusty nail is often ungarnished.\nConsider serving it over a slow-melting iceball to reduce dilution and retain the drink's full flavor.\nRecipe Variation\nAs with many simple classic cocktails, the proportions of the two ingredients will depend on your personal taste. The 2:1 ratio in the recipe is a good starting point, though many rusty nail fans enjoy 4:1 (2 ounces scotch and 1/2 ounce Drambuie).\nWhy Is It Called a Rusty Nail?\nLike many cocktail stories, the true origin of the rusty nail is lost to history. There are speculations, including that it was introduced in 1937 at the British Industries Fair along with a dash of bitters. Another account credits its invention to Manhattan's 21 Club (possibly in the '60s), where the B&B is also said to have originated. It's also unclear when and why the cocktail took its name. One common tale says that it was originally stirred with a rusty nail, while another attributes it to the drink's color. One thing that is not up for debate is that this was a preferred drink for the Rat Pack (Frank Sinatra's gang of five) and they helped its rise to fame.\nWhat's the Best Scotch for a Rusty Nail?\nBlended Scotch whisky is typically used in the rusty nail. Choose a mid- to high-end bottle and save the cheaper bottles for other drinks. Just because blended is preferred, however, don't rule out a single malt scotch; this drink enhances every regional nuance wonderfully. It's a perfect mixed drink for testing new bottles.\nWhat's a Substitute for Drambuie?\nDrambuie is a proprietary liqueur recipe of honey and spices with a scotch base, and its taste is unlike any other liqueur on the market. There's no great substitute and, if replaced, it will no longer be a true rusty nail. The closest liqueur alternative is Glayva, though it's softer, and Chivas Regal's Lochan Ora, which has been discontinued. Neither of those is as easy to find as Drambuie, which is a smart bottle to have in your bar. Not only can you enjoy a rusty nail any time you please, but Drambuie can also be useful in a variety of other cocktails. Plus, it is fabulous on its own or with ginger ale, and at 80-proof, you won't even miss the whisky.\nHow Strong Is the Rusty Nail?\nThe rusty nail is typically made with two 80-proof liquors, though scotch can be stronger. That means it's not only full of flavor but is also among the strongest cocktails you can mix up.

Shake the ingredients well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with an orange peel.\nA Sweeter Cosmo\nIf you prefer a sweeter cranberry flavor in your cosmo, then this is the recipe you\'re looking for. It\'s that signature crimson cocktail that is so often served in cocktail lounges and is the version that most cosmo fans are familiar with:\nShake and strain 1 1/2 ounces citrus vodka, 1/2 ounce each Cointreau and lime juice, and 1 ounce of cranberry juice in a shaker filled with ice.\nGarnish with a citrus peel and serve.\nWho Invented the Cosmopolitan?\nOne of the first references to the cosmopolitan is a gin, Cointreau, lemon, and raspberry syrup mix that was published in 1934 in the ""Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903-1933."" It was not until the \'70s that the drink really took off and transformed into the modern vodka-cranberry cocktail. At that time, bartenders all over the U.S. were experimenting with a cranberry version of the kamikaze. And, as is common in cocktail stories, many people made the claim to creating the cosmo that we know today. It\'s very likely that a few recipes for the cosmo originated simultaneously. Without the internet to share your latest and greatest bar creations with the world, bartenders relied on word of mouth, bartending guides and organizations, and patrons to pass on recipes.\nHow Strong Is the Cosmopolitan?\nThe cosmo can be as strong or as tame as you make it. Here is how these two cosmopolitan recipes stack up with an 80-proof vodka:\nThe main recipe stands at 27 percent ABV (54 proof), whereas the sweeter version has a 20 percent ABV (40 proof). You can see the significant difference between the two. To put the cosmopolitan into perspective: The average vodka martini is 28 percent ABV. The fruity cosmo is not as innocent as she looks, and the sweeter the drink is, the easier it is to have one too many.\n18 Easy Infused Vodka Cocktails']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cosmopolitan-cocktail-recipe-759633

Muddle well to release the essence of the herbs.\nAdd gin and fill the shaker with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a highball glass or mule cup filled with fresh ice. Double straining is recommended if you don't want any hint of small particles or torn herbs in your beverage.\nTop with ginger beer.\nGarnish with a sprig of mint. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nHere are some quick tips on how to choose the best ingredients for your drink:\nLondon dry gin is the preferred style for this recipe because the juniper-forward gin will not get lost in the flavorful mix. Tanqueray is recommended most often, though other brands will do just as well.\nThe ginger beer is the other key ingredient and the ginger beer options do vary from soft to spicy. Here, you're looking for a ginger beer with a great spice and punch of flavor. If you'd like for the flavor of the ginger to fold into the cocktail a bit more, add the ginger beer to the mixing tin after the rest of the ingredients have been shaken but before you pour it into the Collins glass.\nFresh lime juice is preferred and one lime should yield enough for one drink. You can simply cut it in half and squeeze the juice from each half directly into the shaker.\nEnsure your mint is as fresh and fragrant as possible. Some people like to slap the leaves between their palms to wake up the mint before adding it to the shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer vodka over gin, pour it instead. The drink will lose a bit of its flavor but will still be very good.\nLikewise, ginger ale can be used instead of ginger beer, though it's significantly sweeter. For this substitute, cut the simple syrup to about 1/2 ounce in order to maintain the flavor balance.\nHow Strong Is a Gin-Gin Mule?\nJust like most tall soda drinks, the gin-gin mule is relatively tame. With a 4-ounce pour of ginger beer, you're looking at an alcohol content around 12 percent ABV (24 proof). That's similar to a glass of wine, so it's a perfect everyday drink.\nWhy Use Simple Syrup and Not Sugar?\nThe main reason to use simple syrup in a cocktail is that it's easier to mix. Whereas sugar might collect at the bottom of the glass, the simple syrup will dissolve with a quick stir and won't add floating particles or cloud the transparency of the drink.\n\nThe second reason is that you can use flavored simple syrups, and that extra layer of floral, spiced, or fruity accents is actually key in some mixed drinks and cocktails.\n\nLastly, making your own simple syrup will yield a better flavor than bottled versions and significantly reduce your expenses when stocking your bar.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-gin-gin-mule-cocktail-recipe-4137218

Place the mixture in the refrigerator to reach a consistent temperature. \nIn a separate bowl, place the gelatin, and slowly add the boiling water. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved.\nPour the gelatin mixture into the water and liquor mixture. Stir well. If using food coloring to change or enhance the color, add it now.\nPour the mixture into shot glasses, molds, or a baking pan. \nRefrigerate until the liquid sets?at least 2 hours, but overnight is recommended. Serve cold and enjoy.\nFor Fun Shots\nHere are a few expert tips on how to make the best Jell-O shots:\nSmall, plastic shot cups are perfect for serving because a good squeeze pops the shot into your mouth. To make this easier, you could spray some cooking oil into the cups, or rub them with a tiny drop of vegetable oil. This won\'t affect the taste.\nIf making these a couple days ahead of time and/or taking these to a party, buy shot cups with lids to protect your creations and store in the fridge until serving.\nIf you serve the shots in small glasses, it\'s best to provide miniature spoons so guests can dig out the gelatin.\nTo make a bigger Jell-O creation and easily unmold it, reduce the liquid volume slightly. Try a test batch with all the liquids cut in half or double up on the gelatin.\nCustomize Your Shots\nThere are many things you can do to customize your Jell-O shots. Experiment with any of these ideas and be sure to start out with a test batch before scaling up the recipe:\nMix and match flavored gelatin: Use it to replace or enhance a certain flavor. In the margarita Jell-O shot, the lime-flavored gelatin gives a nice boost to the lime juice, but switching to strawberry gelatin creates an imitation of the strawberry margarita.\nUnflavored gelatin: Plain gelatin usually comes in 1/4-ounce envelopes with 2 1/2 teaspoons of gelatin, which should gel the 2 cups of liquid used in this recipe. Use unflavored gelatin when you want other flavors to shine. Some of the shots that use unflavored gelatin can look dull and boring. While the mix is still liquid, change or enhance the color by adding small amounts of food coloring until you get the desired hue.\nFlavored booze: Use flavored vodka, rum, or tequila to add to the flavor of your Jell-O shots.\nColor by flavor: Distinguish flavored shots by their color. Use yellow for a banana daiquiri, red for a planter\'s punch, and blue for a blue Hawaiian.\nRainbow shot: To make layers, begin by making one flavor of gelatin and fill cups 1/2 or 1/3 of the way full. Chill these until it\'s almost set?about 1 to 1 1/2 hours?before adding the next flavor. Repeat until you have completed the layers.\nFruit molds: The rinds of citrus fruits are fun molds for shots. Cut lemons, limes, or oranges in half and remove all of the fruit, leaving the peel intact. Fill this ""bowl"" with the gelatin mixture and allow it to set. Cut each rind into thirds or quarters for single-serve pieces.\nFruity bits: Add small fruit pieces to the gelatin before it sets up. Berries and pitted cherries are the perfect accessories.\nSweeten it up: If the shot is too tart, add simple syrup in lieu of a portion of the cold water?1 ounce or less of syrup should do.\n\nIf you want to experiment, you can transform almost any of your favorite cocktail recipes into a jelly shot. The key is to maintain the original cocktail\'s proportions while keeping the volume of cold liquid at 8 ounces.\nWhy Not Use a Higher-Proof Alcohol?\nEven if you\'d like boozier shots, resist the urge to use a higher-proof liquor such as Everclear. Your best bet is to add a little more of an 80-proof liquor and cut a bit of the cold water. You\'ll want to keep the alcohol content in check, for a few reasons:\nA clear vodka tastes better than Everclear.\nOften, people will have a few Jell-O shots along with other alcohol, so using Everclear in the shots can easily send a person over the edge.\nIf you use a higher-proof liquor, you may have some issues getting the shots to set up, as liquor has a different freezing point than water, so you need to maintain a balance between the alcohol and the other liquids.\nHow Strong Is a Jello Shot?\nIf you make the basic Jell-O shot with a single 80-proof liquor, the alcohol content comes out to be about 12 percent ABV (24 proof). That\'s equivalent to the average wine. While a couple of 1-ounce shots may not get you drunk, overindulging on these shots can happen more quickly than you might expect.\nHow to Make Pudding Shots']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jell-o-shot-recipe-759711

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPumpkin vodka is a very seasonal flavor that makes an appearance every autumn. A few brands have released it over the years, though it's a difficult flavor to sell, so many give up on it after a season or two. Pinnacle Vodka is one that has offered their Pumpkin Pie Vodka regularly in the past. Keep an eye out for others and give them a try in this cocktail.\nIt's actually pretty easy to make your own pumpkin vodka. One fantastic option is used in the pumpkin spice martini. It allows you to use the vodka of your choice and requires roasting peeled pumpkin flavored with bay leaves. The best part is that it's ready in just a few hours, not the days or weeks vodka infusions typically require.\nTo make the most out of the season's produce, consider using freshly-pressed apple cider. It's often available during the fall's apple harvest and is unfiltered, leaving you with a cloudy cider that holds the pure taste of delicious apples. Look for it at apple orchards or in the grocer's produce section.\nRecipe Variations\nThis is a very easy recipe to transform into a punch or mix up by the pitcher. Simply increase the ingredients for the number of servings needed. Remember to keep everything in proportion.\nMake the base (the vodka and cider) ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator to cool. Add the soda to the pitcher just before serving or in the individual serving glasses. It's an excellent way to save time when preparing for guests to arrive and a really nice pre-mixed drink to have on hand for yourself.\nUse another light soda, such as ginger ale or lemon-lime soda, if you prefer.\nConsider rimming the glass with cinnamon sugar. Simply mix one part ground cinnamon with four parts white sugar until you get a consistent light brown color. Wet the rim with an apple slice or lemon juice, then roll the rim in the sugar. Ground nutmeg or ginger can be used too.\nFor alternative garnishes, try a cinnamon stick (doubles as a stir stick) or an apple slice. Apple garnishes should always be dipped in lemon juice immediately after cutting to prevent the fruit's flesh from turning yellow due to oxidation.\nHow Strong Is a Thanksgiving Cider?\nThere's very little need to worry about any holiday blunders around the family with this mixed drink (unless you have a few too many, of course). It's a very light drink with an average alcohol content around 6 percent ABV (12 percent). One glass is a lot like drinking a bottle of beer.\nButternut Squash and Sage Shrub Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/thanksgiving-cider-recipe-760980

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf your drink is a bit too tart, add more syrup. If it is too sweet, add more lime. Additionally, the simple syrup you use will play a role; with a rich (2:1) simple syrup, you won\'t need as much as a daiquiri made with a 1:1 syrup.\nThough a daiquiri isn\'t usually garnished, a lime wedge or twisted lime peel is a good option.\nLike many classic cocktails, the daiquiri is designed to be a short, neat drink, which is why the final volume is only 3 ounces. Considering its strength, this is not a bad thing. You can certainly double the recipe or serve it on the rocks if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Daiquiri?\nThis is not the lightest drink. With an 80-proof rum, the average daiquiri has an alcohol content of 20 percent alcohol by volume (40 proof). One too many can easily sneak up on you. Flavored daiquiris tend to be lower proof thanks to the introduction of additional nonalcoholic ingredients like strawberries, bananas, or additional fruit juice.\nA Little Daiquiri History\nThe daiquiri is thought to have been developed in the late 1800s in Cuba. The name comes from a small town of the same name near Santiago. It was either created as a medicinal treatment or in a ""there\'s no whiskey or gin around... time to doctor up the local rum"" type of scenario. As is often the case with cocktails, there\'s really no way to know for sure which is the truth. Both renditions likely have some factual elements.\nProbably the most famous daiquiri lover was Ernest Hemingway. He also happens to have a variation named after him. The aptly named Hemingway daiquiri adds grapefruit and maraschino liqueur to the mix, and it is another fantastic drink worth trying out.\nRecipe Variations\nThe frozen lime daiquiri is the most basic daiquiri variation. It simply tosses the same three ingredients into a blender with ice. Add whatever fruits you have on hand to give it a quick twist.\nThe strawberry daiquiri is the most popular frozen version. It is also a great shaken cocktail if you\'re not in the mood to fire up the blender.\nThe banana daiquiri is another timeless favorite that is a lot of fun at summer parties. It also serves as inspiration for the tasty banana daiquiri jello shot.\nYou can do some amazing things with a daiquiri base and a few extra ingredients. The rhubarb-rosemary daiquiri, for example, adds rosemary syrup and fresh rhubarb juice to the mix. Likewise, the daiquir-ease recipe uses lavender honey and a blueberry shrub.\nWhat is the difference between a margarita and a daiquiri?\nBoth tart and refreshing classic drinks, there are two main differences between a margarita and a daiquiri. A margarita is typically made with tequila, while a daiquiri is made using rum. And while a daiquiri contains rum, lime juice, and simple syrup, a margarita contains tequila, lime juice, and triple sec (an orange liqueur).\nChef Meg Bickford of Commander\'s Palace Wants You to Start Cooking With Booze']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-daiquiri-recipe-759294

The two brands happen to be the most popular of their respective flavor categories so they're often stocked in bars and easy to find in nearly any liquor store.\nChoose the dairy product according to your taste. Typically, dairy drinks served on the rocks are better with a heavier option such as cream because the ice will dilute it as you drink. Whole or 2 percent milk would be preferred over lighter options. Half-and-half is the middle ground; it's not too light or rich but adds a nice creaminess.\nThe nuts and berries cocktail is also excellent with dairy alternatives. Almond milk is one of the best options and ramps up the drink's nuttiness in a delightful way.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a martini version, pour 1 ounce of each ingredient into a shaker filled with ice. Shake well and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nYou can also enjoy this as a shot; simply eliminate the dairy and pour the liqueurs into a shot glass.\nAdd 1 ounce of raspberry vodka to the martini, and you have a cocktail that's also called the PB&J. Take it further and add 1 ounce of banana liqueur for a PB&J with bananas.\nAmaretto is a nice substitute for a hazelnut liqueur, though not quite as nutty.\nNo milk or cream in the fridge? Pour Irish cream or another cream liqueur like RumChata instead.\nIf you prefer to skip the fruit, mix up a nutty Irishman. It can be served as a shot, on the rocks, or in a hot coffee cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Nuts and Berries?\nPouring as much or as little dairy as you like will affect how strong the drink is, though it's almost always a relatively mild cocktail. For instance, if you pour 3 ounces of milk, the drink will weigh in around 9 percent alcohol by volume (18 proof).\nCreating Delicious Dairy Cocktails at Home""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/nuts-and-berries-frangelico-and-chambord-759749

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf the mix is too thick once blended, add more juice. When it's too thin for your taste, add more ice. After either addition, blend the drink again.\nThe fresh lime juice really does make a better margarita, especially when it's the star fruit. Since the average lime typically yields about 1 ounce of juice, simply squeeze two halves directly into the blender.\nWhen choosing the tequila, you may be tempted to save some money on a budget brand because this is a blended cocktail. However, the lime flavoring is very transparent and will not cover up any of the liquor's undesirable characteristics. Your best bet is to pick a tequila (typically blanco) that you enjoy on its own.\nThe same quality consideration should apply to the triple sec. If you enjoy margaritas, you'll use it often, so invest a little more and you'll see an improvement in all of your cocktails. Cointreau is the best-known premium triple sec, though there are others that match its quality.\nRecipe Variations\nOnce you get the hang of the lime margarita, you'll want to add more flavor. It's often as simple as adding fresh or frozen fruits to the blender, though some margarita recipes add fruity liqueurs as well. You can go with a single fruit like the famous strawberry margarita or create a custom combination?a banana-strawberry-lime margarita is utterly delicious. It's really hard to mess it up and you get to drink your experiments, which is the best part!\nHow Strong Is a Lime Margarita?\nWhen you mix your margarita in a blender, the ice significantly reduces the cocktail's alcohol content.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou may need to adjust the thickness of your banana split cocktail while it's still in the blender. Want a thicker drink? Add another scoop of ice cream. For a thinner drink, add a splash of milk. Blend it up and continue making small adjustments until it has reached your desired consistency.\nIf you have too much to fit into your glass, simply store the remainder in the freezer until you're ready for the next round.\nChocolate vodka is the star of this cocktail and you have a few options. Two of the better choices are Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate and 360 Double Chocolate. Both are richly flavored and fantastically smooth. Pinnacle Chocolate Whipped is another fun one that you should have an easy time finding.\nOther than Pinnacle, you will have to look to another brand for the strawberry vodka. For this flavor, some of the recommendations include Smirnoff Strawberry, Stoli Strasberi, and Three Olives Strawberry. \nStrawberry vodka is also an easy one that you can make at home. The infusion should take right around a week and it's an ideal project to take on during strawberry season. If you like, you can even sweeten it a bit by adding around 1/2 cup simple syrup to a full 750 ml batch. Technically, this creates a homemade liqueur and it is actually a little tastier than a straight strawberry infusion.\nWhile it seems pretty obvious that a banana is a banana, there is a little trick that you'll want to know. When making frozen cocktails with bananas, it's best if you peel and freeze the banana before adding it to the blender. This creates a slightly creamier drink than you would get from the banana sitting on your kitchen counter.\nTop Your Banana Split However You Like\nAs with the banana split, feel free to indulge as much as you like when garnishing this cocktail. While a simple dollop of whipped cream with chopped nuts is nice, you can certainly take it much farther.\nAdd a cherry or strawberry and maybe a slice or two of frozen bananas if you like. A drizzle of chocolate syrup or caramel is also a fun option, though you could use strawberry syrup or your favorite berry liqueur as well. Candy sprinkles add a festive little touch, as can any of your favorite cake decorating toppings.\nHave fun with your finishing touches. After all, this is a boozy banana split, so don't hold back now!\nRecipe Variation\nNo ice cream? Not a problem! Whether you find yourself out of ice cream or simply want to skip the dairy, there is another option. You can create a frozen banana split with ice instead. This creates more of a smoothie-like texture that's a lot like a frozen margarita.\nTo do this, keep the vodkas, banana, and pineapple juice from the recipe. Instead of ice cream and milk, add 1 cup of ice to the blender and blend until smooth.\nIf you want to add a little creaminess, pour in 1 ounce of Irish cream, Rumchata, or half and half (or a nondairy alternative). Add the cream ingredient while the blender is going by drizzling it through the center lid of your blender. Some of these options like to curdle and this little trick should prevent that.\nHow Strong Is a Frozen Banana Split Cocktail?\nUnless you overpour the liquor, most frozen cocktails are in no way strong drinks.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe average orange yields between 2 and 3 ounces of juice, so you can easily get a couple of drinks out of a single fruit.\nIf you opt for bottled juice, choose one that is pulp-free and not from concentrate for the best tasting drink.\nFor the triple sec, Cointreau and Combier are two premium options that will make a great cosmo. Some of the less expensive brands can be very syrupy, so if you want to improve all of your drinks (including margaritas), keep a quality brand in stock.\nA twist of orange peel is a great alternative garnish to a full slice because it looks very elegant when draped over the rim of a cocktail glass. You can also twist it over the drink with a gentle squeeze to express the peel's oils, giving it an extra kiss of brilliant citrus flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nMix up a small pitcher of this cocktail to make serving it at a dinner party quick and easy. Simply multiply all of the ingredients for the number of drinks you need and stir it up with ice before your guests arrive. Keep it cool in the refrigerator.\nBring back the cosmo's cranberry flavor by pouring cranberry juice rather than orange.\nHow Strong Is a Campari Cosmo?\nThe Campari cosmo is designed to be a short cocktail that's enjoyed with appetizers or dinner. You're not likely to mix up more than one round a night and that's a good thing because it's a pretty strong cocktail. It mixes up to 23 percent ABV (46 proof), which is twice the strength of a glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/skyy-campari-cosmo-recipe-761165

Citrus vodkas or any light fruit flavors are great options, and cake or whipped cream vodkas can add a sweet, creamy background.\nVodka-Free Version\nThis recipe is the straight amaretto and juice version of the bocce ball, and it's equally delicious. It is a nice option for those days when you want a lower-proof drink and it is perfect for a casual brunch when made with fresh orange juice.\nAgain, the soda is a nice finishing touch that lightens up the drink, though you can easily skip it.\nTo make this drink, pour 2 ounces of amaretto into an ice-filled collins glass. Add fresh orange juice and a splash of club soda.\nThe Bocce Ball Bomb Shot\nThe bocce ball's ingredients can also be used to create a bomb shot, which is when a shot of liquor is dropped into a tall glass filled with a second beverage. Amaretto and orange juice are all that you will need, and you will find that it is considerably less intense than the Irish slammer or J?ger bomb. You don't have to fill the pint glass with orange juice. Instead, pour just 4 to 5 ounces, or fill the glass about 1/3 of the way full. Fill a shot glass with amaretto, then drop the shot into the pint glass and drink.\nHow Strong Are These Bocce Ball Drinks?\nSurprisingly, despite the hard liquor, these bocce ball drinks are not much stronger than the average beer or glass of wine. The vodka does make the first recipe the strongest of the three, though each is nice and mild in comparison to many other cocktails.\n\nTo estimate their strength, let's assume that we poured an amaretto that's on the low end of the liqueur's spectrum, just 42 proof. For the vodka, we'll use the 80-proof standard because there are only a few bottles around that go above that. Each drink would be approximately the following strength:\nBocce ball with vodka: 8 percent ABV (16 proof)\nBocce ball without vodka: 5 percent ABV (10 proof)\nBocce ball bomb shot: 6 percent ABV (12 proof)""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bocce-ball-cocktail-recipe-761017

Serve and enjoy.\nWhy Is It Called a Tom & Jerry?\nCocktail origin stories are typically interesting to trace, and there are often multiple accounts. Contrary to what you might think, this one doesn\'t refer to the classic cartoon characters. (It\'s possible the characters reference the drink, but that\'s up for debate.)\n\nOne story says that the drink was named after British journalist Pierce Egan\'s book ""Life in London: Or The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorne, Esq., and His Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom."" A play was staged shortly after its publication in 1821, and it\'s said that Egan named the drink as a cross-promotion for its debut.\n\nIn cocktail historian David Wondrich\'s book ""Imbibe!"" (2nd edition, 2015), he makes no mention of Egan. Instead, he recounts the story that ""Professor"" Jerry Thomas often told, which claimed he named it after two pet mice. Wondrich also points out that this was a barman\'s tale because Thomas was born in 1830 and would have started bartending in the 1840s. An 1827 article in the Salem Gazette referenced the drink in a court case about a young boy acquitted of stealing, who apparently had been drunk on ""Tom and Jerry"" at the time.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk of foodborne illness.\nRecipe Variations\nSome recipes skip the spices and vanilla in the batter. In this case, consider garnishing with a mix of ground cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg to spice up the drink.\nA few of the older recipes use a considerable amount of sugar and skip the butter altogether, typically when mixing the drink with hot water to give it more froth and cream.\nOther recipes are written without the premade batter. Whipping egg whites is not an easy task, though, so it\'s smarter to do this in bulk rather than with just an egg or two at a time. Take advantage of the fact that this recipe yields ample batter.\nHow Strong Is a Tom & Jerry?\nThere may be two liquors in the Tom & Jerry, but there\'s also a lot of warm milk, so it\'s a surprisingly light beverage. On average, it mixes up to 12 percent ABV (24 proof). That\'s equivalent to a glass of wine, but this drink is far more comforting.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tom-and-jerry-cocktail-recipe-760573

Most martinis are best with top-shelf vodka, but you don't have to be quite so picky with the chocolate martini because of its deep flavor. To balance quality and a budget, find a good, mid-range vodka. Those produced by today's craft distillers are excellent candidates, as are any of the big names in the vodka market.\nYou can use either white or dark cr?me de cacao. Only the color will change, not the taste.\nIf you want a creamy martini, switch to a creamier chocolate liqueur. There are many delicious options available, such as Godiva and Dorda. Both are made by famed chocolatiers, so you know they're delicious.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can add a little extra flavor by pouring a flavored vodka. Have fun with berry, coconut, or coffee vodkas for a fun twist. Citrus pairs well with chocolate as well. Vanilla vodka is a more obvious choice, and if you want to load up on the chocolate, go for a chocolate vodka. Any of the dessert-flavored vodkas, such as whipped cream, make a tasty martini, too. \nA quick way to give this recipe a creamy touch is to pour Irish cream or dairy cream. To maintain balance, add just 1/2 ounce or so.\nIs Cr?me de Cacao the Same as Chocolate Liqueur?\nCr?me de cacao is a chocolate liqueur made from the cacao bean. It has a subtle vanilla taste and comes in both dark and white versions that taste the same. Cr?me de cacao can be enjoyed on its own or used as an ingredient in cocktails and desserts. Chocolate liqueur, on the other hand, is made of cream and chocolate and is sweeter and more syrup-like. It can, however, be used in place of cr?me de cacao in recipes.\nHow Strong Is a Chocolate Martini?\nMost chocolate liqueurs are low-proof, and that helps bring this booze-only martini down to a decent strength. For example, if you make this chocolate martini with Godiva (17 percent ABV), its alcohol content will fall around 26 percent ABV (52 proof). It is not the lightest cocktail, but certainly not the strongest, either. Just don't let the sweet taste fool you into drinking too many.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/chocolate-martini-recipe-759628

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFor the best Scotch and soda, be selective about which brand of soda you choose. A high-quality, craft club soda tends to have a cleaner profile and is a really nice complement to a decent Scotch.\nWhen serving it short, consider using an ice ball or large cube. These will melt slower than smaller cubes and prolong the drink's full flavor.\nRecipe Variation\nThe two styles are very similar in taste, so switch from Scotch to Japanese whisky. In Japan, the highball drink is preferred. It's typically 1 1/2 ounces of whisky stirred with ice (often a long hand-carved cube) then topped with 4 to 5 ounces of soda.\nWhat's the Best Scotch for a Scotch and Soda?\nFrom blended to single malts, any Scotch whisky can be used in a Scotch and soda, and it's a fantastic option when exploring new-to-you bottles. The beauty of this drink is that you can easily tailor it to fit the whisky you're pouring at the moment. For instance, when you have a great single malt, add just a splash of premium soda, but for a casual happy hour, choose an affordable blended whisky and fill a tall glass with soda.\nWhat Soda Goes Good With Scotch?\nClear, unsweetened sodas are preferred in a Scotch and soda. Club soda is the easiest choice, though plain soda water out of a soda maker is excellent as well. Sparkling water tends to be less carbonated but is a good option. That said, ginger ale is commonly paired with whiskey in highballs, lemon-lime sodas add a sweet citrus spin, and Scotch and cola is a popular drink throughout Europe. Try different Scotches and other styles of whiskeys with various sodas to find your personal favorites for different moods.\nHow Strong Is the Scotch and Soda?\nThe Scotch to soda ratio is a variable that will factor into the actual alcohol content of your drink. If your whisky is 80 proof (Scotch varies greatly), one made with 1 ounce of soda will fall in the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range. Pouring 4 ounces of soda will easily cut that in half.\nRusty Nail Cocktail Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/scotch-and-soda-recipe-761494

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you like, stir the ingredients in a cocktail shaker filled with ice and strain it into the frozen glass.\nChoose Your Gin\nOnly a dash of vermouth and cura?ao are used in the recipe, so they are merely light accents to the gin. That is why it is important to choose a high-quality gin, just like you would for any other martini. Your choice of gin will make or break this drink.\nNaturally, given the name, Bombay Sapphire is a perfect option. It has long been the gin of choice in bars across the world for the sapphire martini. Though it looks like the gin is blue, that is only the color of the glass. Once you pour it, you'll find it to be as clear as any other gin. That is another reason why blue cura?ao (not white or orange) is required for this cocktail.\nHow Strong Is the Sapphire Martini?\nAs with most martinis, the sapphire martini is made entirely of alcohol and that means that this is not a weak drink. In fact, it is slightly lower than the bottling proof of gin, with an alcohol content of 36 percent ABV (72 proof).\n\nWhy is it so strong? Notice that the recipe doesn't actually ask you to mix the gin, therefore no ice is added to dilute it. That simple little omission makes this one of the strongest martinis you can make.\n\nFor comparison sake, if you were to stir the drink with ice, that dilution would bring the mix down to 30 percent ABV (60 proof).

Hendrick\'s, Bombay, and Beefeater are all excellent choices.\nChoose a sweet vermouth that\'s of equal quality to the gin and Campari. Carpano Antica, Cocchi, and Dolin are all good choices.\nIf you have to dust off the vermouth bottle, it\'s likely time to replace it. The fortified wine has a shelf life of just three months once the bottle is open.\nRecipe Variations\nAdjust the Campari if needed. This is particularly important if you are new to bitter aperitifs, because it is not a taste that everyone is accustomed to?especially Americans. We have learned to enjoy sweet drinks and the occasional dry cocktail, but bitters are in an entirely different realm.\nIf you pour a full-strength Negroni and find that it\'s too much for you, try ""training your palate"" to enjoy the bitter taste. Cut the Campari in half and double up on the gin the next time you mix one up. After a while, your taste buds will become used to the unique taste, and you can work back up to the original recipe.\nNot a fan of gin? Pour vodka instead. The drink will be similar to a Campari cocktail, though the vermouth is a nice addition.\nHow to Make Negronis for a Crowd\nThe Negroni is one of the easiest cocktails to batch because it uses equal parts of only three ingredients. To make a large batch of this drink for a party:\nMultiply each ingredient by the number of servings you want to batch.\nUse the resulting numbers to help you figure out how many bottles of each ingredient you\'ll need to buy. Remember that drinks are usually sold in 750mL bottles. 750mL is approximately 25 1/4 ounces.\nOnce you have your ingredients, measure them out according to the math you did in step 1.\nMix the ingredients together, place in a serving vessel, and chill well.\nTo serve, pour 3 ounces of the batched cocktail into an ice-filled glass. Stir well, garnish, and serve.\n\nRead more about batching cocktails here.\nThe History of the Negroni\nIt\'s widely believed that the Negroni was created and named for Count Camillo Negroni in the 1920s. The story goes that the drink was invented when he ordered an Americano with gin at Caff? Casoni in Florence, Italy.\nIs it true? There\'s really no definitive answer. As often happens in the cocktail world, the story has been muddled over the years. Even the question of Count Negroni\'s existence has been brought into question. This has led to some great debates and a lot of research into the origin of the Negroni.1\nHow Strong Is the Negroni?\nThe Negroni is made entirely of liquor, and as with all drinks of this sort, it is not a weak drink. It\'s also not the strongest, though it does give the classic dry martini a run for its money. On average, you can expect a Negroni\'s alcohol content to be somewhere around 24 percent ABV (48 proof).

It should keep well for at least a month and can be stored just like any other liqueur. Refrigeration is not required.\nTips\nIf you notice the flavorings are separating from the liqueur, give the bottle a really good shake to incorporate them.\nWhenever you make liqueurs at home, keep in mind that the quality of the base liquor will affect the taste of your finished product. While it's not necessary to use top-shelf vodka, your amaretto will be better off with a vodka you wouldn't mind drinking on its own. Luckily, there are a number of great tasting inexpensive vodkas on the market that are perfect for projects like this.\nThe recipe makes about 750 ml (3 cups) of amaretto, which is the same as a fifth (the average-sized liquor bottle). This makes it very convenient to recycle your vodka bottle to store your amaretto under a tight seal.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer, use whole vanilla beans instead of vanilla extract. Typically, one bean should be enough to add a nice flavor, though some people prefer two. Cut the vanilla bean into pieces and add it while making the syrup?after the sugar has dissolved. Let it continue to steep for about an hour after adding the vodka and almond extract. Strain out the bean before bottling.\nRum makes a nice base for homemade amaretto as well. A white rum would be an excellent choice, though you could add dimension to the liqueur's flavor by using an aged rum.\nUse this recipe as inspiration for other easy homemade liqueurs. For instance, you could use mint extract and white sugar exclusively to create a mint-flavored liqueur.\nAnother possibility is to add any flavor you like with fresh herbs or fruits to create a flavored simple syrup before blending it with vodka and water. For most flavors, a little vanilla extract will round out the taste with a nice richness.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Amaretto?\nWhen made with an 80-proof vodka, your homemade amaretto should have a final alcohol content around 26 percent ABV (52 proof).

Marie Brizard and Bols make excellent and affordable options.\nThe easiest way to add a splash of lime juice is to squeeze a lime wedge into the shaker.\nAs with any shaken pineapple juice cocktail, this will get a little foamy on top but it will settle in the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nBlend this margarita if you like. Simply combine all the ingredients, except the soda, in a blender with 1 cup of ice (about 5 cubes). Blend until smooth and pour into a tall glass, finishing up with a splash of soda.\nRim the glass with sugar or salt. Blue-colored sugar is a fun addition, too.\nDouble up on the pineapple and cura?ao and add more soda, then serve this drink in a taller glass over ice (perfect for mason jar glasses). Not only will your margarita last longer, but it will also be gentler. Depending on how much soda you pour, the alcohol content can be cut in half.\nAdd a hint of coconut by pouring 1/2 ounce of coconut rum or vodka, or cream of coconut.\nNo blue cura?ao? Pour another orange liqueur instead. Though orange cura?ao, triple sec, or liqueurs like Grand Marnier won't produce the blue color, the drink will taste the same.\nHow Strong Is a Blue Lagoon Margarita?\nLike most shaken margaritas, this is a strong drink.

Serve and enjoy!\nTips\nMake this cocktail immediately before serving so the wine remains effervescent.\nIf you\'re preparing a number of glasses for a party, pour the Chambord into each glass ahead of time. Then all you have to do is top each off with champagne when you\'re ready to serve.\nNo stirring is required with this cocktail. The bubbles from the wine will do all the mixing for you, so it\'s an incredibly easy drink to mix up.\nWhile champagne is recommended for this drink, any sparkling wine will create a great cocktail. Prosecco, cava, or a sparkling ros? can be used in place of the champagne.\nChambord is a very sweet liqueur, so you might find it best to pair it with a drier wine. Any champagne with ""brut"" on the label will be the driest and the best choice for this drink. Extra dry champagne is a touch sweeter but retains dryness so the cocktail should maintain a fair balance. Most drinkers will find that a ""demi-sec"" is just too sweet for the liqueur.\nRecipe Variations\nYou might want to add another garnish to this cocktail. An elegant option is a long lemon or orange twist that drapes over the rim and floats inside the glass. You can also float a few cranberries or pomegranate seeds in the drink.\nUse this simple recipe as inspiration for other champagne cocktails. Browse your liquor cabinet for similarly sweet fruit liqueurs or pick up a new bottle at the liquor store. Apple, lychee, mango, pear, pomegranate, and strawberry liqueurs would all work nicely as Chambord substitutes for various occasions and seasons.\nIt\'s very easy to create a non-alcoholic version of this cocktail. Simply pour a raspberry syrup, then top it with a sparkling cider or grape juice. Grenadine can be used as well and will give your drink a pomegranate flavor.\nHow Strong Is This Drink?\nIf you were to pour a full 6 ounces of wine to fill a flute, you can expect this cocktail to have an alcohol content of about 13 percent ABV (26 proof). This is just one point higher than the average champagne, so the Chambord does not make much of an impact in making the drink stronger.\nStrawberry Vodka Champagne Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/champagne-and-chambord-cocktail-759619

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWhile Tanqueray is the recommended gin for this toddy recipe, almost any gin will work well. Traditional London dry gins are preferred because they have that distinct juniper-forward profile, and that boldness really is what makes this a great drink.\nFor even more flavor, opt for a high-proof gin. Intense gins like Martin Miller Westbourne Strength and Leopold Bros. Navy Strength will create a toddy you will not forget.\nIt\'s best to treat this like brewing a cup of tea, with hot?not boiling?water. If the water is too hot, it can ""bruise"" the gin\'s botanicals and ruin an otherwise perfect drink. Your teapot should get it to the right temperature or you can heat water for about 30 to 45 seconds in the microwave.\nThough garnishes are often optional, consider the cinnamon stick a requirement for the gin toddy. It adds just a little more dimension to the flavor and doubles as a stir stick to keep everything mixed as you drink.\nRecipe Variations\nAs with any hot toddy, it\'s best to customize the accent ingredients to suit your personal taste and the liquor you pour. Feel free to adjust both the lemon and sugar as needed. Begin with just a little of each, take a sip, and stir in more if as you see fit.\nUse your favorite type of sugar. White granulated sugar is an easy choice, though raw sugars and coconut sugar are excellent as well.\nSimple syrup can be used in place of granulated sugar. Begin with just a dash because you do not want the drink to become too sweet. Agave nectar and honey are also great sweeteners for any toddy.\nIt\'s best to use fresh lemon juice. This can be as easy as cutting a lemon wedge and squeezing it directly into the warm drink. Prepared lemon juices are okay, though it\'s best to start with just a few dashes, then adjust to taste.\nIs Hot Gin Good for a Cold?\nThe warmth of the botanicals in the gin toddy may soothe a sore throat and reduce congestion. Of course, it will not cure your cold. In the same way as a cup of herbal tea, it may provide temporary relief, particularly when sweetened with honey1.\n\nThere is no cure for the common cold2, and drinking gin in any form will not prevent or kill cold and flu viruses. In 2018, there was even a claim that drinking gin and tonics could cure a cold. The original article did not cite the ""study"" reported to produce this evidence, but the headline caught a lot of attention and, unfortunately, it went viral. Some of these misconceptions are due to juniper berries, which are the key flavoring ingredient in gin. While the berries do contain antioxidants and vitamin C, very little of that is carried through to the gin3.\n\nIt\'s important to remember that alcohol can negatively interact with cold medications you may be taking and dehydrates the body. Studies4 have also indicated that alcohol may lower the immune system\'s ability to fight viruses. If you\'re sick and want to drink a toddy, stick to one then move on to other forms of relief, including lots of nonalcoholic fluids.\nHow Strong Is a Hot Gin Toddy?\nIf you choose to pour a standard 80 proof gin into your toddy, the drink is comforting, flavorful, and not too strong. Its alcohol content will be right around 14 percent ABV (28 proof), so it\'s a bit like enjoying a glass of wine.\n10 Warm and Soothing Hot Toddy Recipes to Try Tonight']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hot-gin-toddy-recipe-760085

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nA lime wedge is almost always served with the gin and tonic, and it's a fantastic way to add a hint of citrus. Get the most out of it by running the wedge around the rim of the glass, squeeze the juice into the drink, then drop the wedge in.\nTo add even more lime flavor, squeeze in the juice from a second wedge or add a splash of lime cordial before topping it with tonic.\nThere is a fantastic array of gins to choose from today. Your gin and tonic can become an entirely new experience with each gin you pour. For a traditional G&T, a London dry gin like Beefeater or Tanqueray is a good choice. You can also opt for the cucumber of Hendrick's, the florals of Aviation, or the soft sweetness of Hayman's Old Tom Gin.\nFor the best experience, use freshly opened bottles of well-chilled tonic.\nRecipe Variations\nThe gin and tonic may be simple, but it's also a great foundation for experimentation. With a few changes here and there, you can create an entirely new drink.\nIf you are not a fan of gin, there is always the vodka tonic.\nWhiskey drinkers will enjoy the leprechaun with Irish whiskey.\nA splash of fruit juice, such as apple, cranberry, or orange, adds a hint of flavor and sweetness to this typically dry drink.\nUse a lemon wedge in place of or in addition to lime garnish.\nAnother option is to add 1/2 ounce or so of your favorite liqueur or flavored syrup. Amaretto makes a semisweet gin and tonic, or enjoy a garden-fresh strawberry tonic with homemade syrup (it works for other fruits, too). You can even turn to that trusted bottle of grenadine.\nMuddle raspberries, mango, or other fresh fruits in the glass before building the drink.\nInfuse extra flavor into the gin or vodka. The autumn spiced tonic recipe uses apple, pear, and cinnamon for vodka, and there are many gin infusions that are an excellent base for tonic as well.\nHow Strong Is a Gin and Tonic?\nThe gin and tonic can be as light or as strong as you want to make it. The strength is controlled by the amount of tonic you pour. With the average 5-ounce pour of tonic and an 80-proof gin, the drink weighs in around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). It's a very casual drink, which is why it's a favorite to serve at dinner.\nIs Tonic Water Healthy?\nNutritionally, tonic water does not provide much value. Though not as much as other soft drinks, it typically includes sugar or some other sweetener. The amount varies by brand and will affect the calorie count.\nIs It Safe to Drink Tonic Water Every Day?\nIt is generally harmless for most people to drink tonic water daily in moderation. Quinine is the ingredient in tonic water that is responsible for its semi-bitter and dry taste. The alkaloid is derived from cinchona bark and can lead to quinine toxicity (cinchonism) in high doses. This is most often a concern in medication form or for people with certain medical conditions, and it can interact with some medications.1\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff To ensure the tonic water sold in the U.S. is safe, the FDA limits how much quinine can be present in tonic water.2\nCan I Make Tonic Water at Home?\nMany types of soda are fun to make at home. However, tonic water is one that should always be purchased from a reputable manufacturer. Due to the serious side effects of cinchonism, it can be harmful to make your own tonic syrup from cinchona bark because it is impossible to control the amount of quinine.3 It is generally safe to purchase a premade tonic syrup if you follow the company's recommended dilution to make tonic water.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nGive this drink a really good shake for at least 30 seconds to thoroughly mix the ingredients. The maple syrup and pumpkin puree are not as easily mixed as typical cocktail ingredients, so putting a little more effort into it will help.\nTo ensure a clean drink, it is wise to fine-strain this drink. Simply use your normal cocktail strainer and pour through a fine-mesh strainer that's placed over the glass. This should catch any extra pumpkin chunks.\nFor the bourbon, choose a top-shelf whiskey, just like you would for any old-fashioned recipe. This one would actually be best with a really bold bourbon because it will not get lost against the pumpkin. Look for anything that's bottled higher than 80-proof.\nPumpkin puree is a great way to transform the flesh into a useful ingredient for food, as well as drinks. If you don't want to use canned, there are a couple of simple ways to make it from fresh pumpkin. The quickest method bakes pieces of pumpkin in a 350 F oven for 45 to 60 minutes. You can also make pumpkin puree in a slow cooker, cooking the pieces on low for about 5 hours. With either, use a food processor or electric mixer to mix the soft pumpkin into a smooth puree.\nRecipe Variations\nTry this recipe with your favorite rye whiskey rather than bourbon. The whiskey's signature spice is a great complement to pumpkin.\nIf you'd like an alternative to maple syrup, mix up a batch of spiced brown sugar syrup. It includes allspice, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg and will give the cocktail a pumpkin pie-like accent.\nHow Strong Is a Pumpkin Old-Fashioned?\nAny variation on the old-fashioned cocktail is going to be relatively strong because the drink is designed to feature bourbon in a slightly dressed up form.

Serve and enjoy.\nA Wisconsin Favorite\nThere are many variations on the classic old-fashioned. Some are more popular than others and some, like the brandy old-fashioned, have become entrenched in the drinking habits of certain regions.\nWisconsin\'s affinity for this drink is one of wonder. Just how did this state come to enjoy a version of the classic cocktail that is rarely found elsewhere in the U.S.? It\'s a question that many people have asked and one that Dy Godsey wrote about for Edible Milwaukee. \nThe answers may lie in the primarily German settlers who made Wisconsin home. With a preference for brandy over whiskey, it seems that the brandy old-fashioned was a natural fit. It is also likely due to Korbel Brandy\'s introduction to Wisconsinites during the 1893 Chicago World\'s Fair.\nDrink Like You\'re in Wisconsin\nHow do you drink a brandy old-fashioned like a true Wisconsinite? Korbel brandy is almost always poured in the state, so that\'s a good start. Some people prefer plain seltzer, though the lemon-lime sodas are a favorite.\nAlso, because bartenders mix up so many of these, many create a mix called ""bug juice"" to save time. Essentially, they\'re creating a ready-to-pour mixture of sugar, water, and bitters?foregoing the muddle completely.\nWhile that\'s a good adaptation in a busy bar, home bartenders will find that making the brandy old-fashioned according to this recipe an easier way to go. It does not take much time at all and in a few minutes, you will have a great drink. Though everyone in Wisconsin may put their personal spin on the drink, this recipe is accepted as authentic.\nHow Strong Is a Brandy Old-Fashioned?\nSince there are no significant liquid mixers, the brandy old-fashioned will be just slightly weaker than a straight pour of brandy. A little dilution should be factored in from the ice and soda, which makes the drink\'s final alcohol content somewhere around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).\nRum Old-Fashioned']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-old-fashioned-recipe-759417

You can use either roasted or chocolate-covered nibs in the infusion.\nNearly any whiskey will work for the infusion, though the spiciness of rye is a great backdrop for the sweet chocolate.

The drink can still have a good balance of sweet and tart with 2 or 3 ounces of juice. If it becomes too tart, you can always add another splash of grenadine.\nLight rum is a great choice for this mixed drink and it's also very interesting with aged rums.\nSour mix is very easy to make at home because it's just a citrus flavored syrup. To make it, bring 1 cup of water to a boil, stir in 1 cup of sugar until it dissolves, then reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.

When bottling, it's nice to add a couple of dashes of orange flower water.\nFresh-squeezed grapefruit juice is worth your time in this cocktail, though bottled juice works just fine. A single grapefruit can yield up to 6 ounces of juice, so you'll have plenty for a few cocktails or enough to store in the refrigerator for later.\nRecipe Variation\nHave fun with flavored rum in this drink. Citrus rum would be an excellent choice and you can even ramp up the grapefruit with that flavor of rum. Other good options worth trying include tropical fruits like mango and pineapple. Vanilla rum will add a nice, rich flavor dimension, too.\nHow Strong Is a Ruby Rum Sunrise?\nRum is the only liquor in this cocktail, so it is a pretty mild drink. If you were to pour an 80-proof rum, its alcohol content should fall into the 16 percent ABV (32 proof) range.

When converting it to a large drink, you\'ll find it best to increase the volume with sparkling lemonade (or a combination of pink lemonade and sparkling wine).\nThe average pitcher holds just over 60 ounces and you want to leave room for ice. In this case, begin by muddling 3 large slices of watermelon (or enough to get 1 cup of juice) with about 1/4 cup of parsley leaves. Let the herb steep in the fruit juice for about 1 hour.

Navel oranges can replace blood oranges in the summer, and you can use canned apricots in the middle of winter.\nThough Hennessy Black is the recommended Cognac, any brandy will work out just fine in this punch.

It\'s entirely different than all others, and that\'s what makes it great.\nThis drink has a lighter profile because it skips the heaviness of orange juice and opts for refreshing pineapple instead. It also features two rums and introduces the rich texture of an egg white. All of these elements give DeGroff\'s rum runner a classic style that\'s lost in most modern renditions of the cocktail.\nTo make this drink, muddle a piece of lime in the bottom of a cocktail shaker until lightly bruised. Add 1 ounce each of light and medium rums, pineapple juice, and simple syrup, as well as 1/2 ounce of lime juice and an egg white. Shake vigorously (more than usual to properly mix the egg) and strain into a tall glass with ice. Garnish with tropical fruit.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk for foodborne illness.\nHow Strong Are the Rum Runner Cocktails?\nRum-filled tropical cocktails are generally not light drinks, though they can be as strong as you want to make them. If you pour stronger rum or use less juice, you will naturally get a stronger drink.\n\nTo estimate the alcohol content of these rum runner recipes, let\'s assume you pour 80-proof rums, a 60-proof banana liqueur, and a 50-proof blackberry liqueur. The first recipe includes two rums and two liqueurs, so it comes in at a rather potent 25 percent ABV (42 proof), or similar to a fruity martini. The other recipes include more juice per volume and are a more relaxing 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That\'s more like drinking a glass of wine.\nWho Invented the Rum Runner?\nThe Holiday Isle Tiki Bar in Key West, Florida, claims to be the originator of the rum runner cocktail. Rumor has it, the bar was overstocked with rums and a bartender invented the fruity drink in 1972 to use up both light and dark rums.

Serve with a straw and enjoy.\nTips\nGently muddle your mint. The intention is to release the essential oils, not tear the leaves to bits.\nMaking crushed ice without a machine is another use for your muddler: Place ice cubes in a Lewis bag (a cloth bag made specifically for this purpose) or wrap it in a towel and whack it until your cubes become finely crushed ice. (This is a wonderful and safe stress reliever, too.)\nOnce you build the drink, take the time to stir it gently until the glass gets frosty. This should take at least 30 seconds, but the longer you do it, the better.\nPour your favorite bourbon. It's best to choose one of the higher-end brands for the simple fact that bourbon is the Julep's only liquid. Though it is sweetened and flavored, the whiskey is primarily what you will taste.\nBefore garnishing with the mint sprig, gently slap it with your hands to release the aromatic oils of the mint.\nMint Juleps are good for sipping but also pair nicely with Southern appetizers. Try pairing with pickled shrimp, deviled eggs, and pimiento cheese dip.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Mint Julep has been around for so long that it has been adapted countless times. The technique for mixing it has been simplified, and ingredients have been added or substituted to create new variations. While the classic cocktail is fantastic, it's fun to explore all your options.\nAs an alternative to muddling the mint and sugar, you can infuse simple syrup with mint. You can skip right to pouring and stirring, and it's a good way to preserve fresh mint that's starting to go bad.\nThere are also many Mint Julep-inspired recipes to explore. You can enjoy a White Peach Julep or one that features ginger, for instance. Some take a completely different approach and swap the whiskey out for gin or brandy, too.\nThe taste of the Mint Julep is also captured fantastically in a frozen ice pop. It's perfect for the hot days of summer.\nHow Strong Is a Mint Julep?\nThe Mint Julep has a pleasant taste, but it includes a long shot of bourbon and little else to knock down its alcohol content. If you make it with an 80-proof whiskey, it should weigh in somewhere around 28 percent ABV (56 proof). The drink will be even stronger with higher proof bourbons.

You can use other brands of cola or artisanal colas as you prefer.\nLight rum is usually chosen for the Cuba libre, and to be traditional, you should use a Cuban-style rum. However, if you like dark rum, you can give that a try in your cocktail.\nIf you want to make a more complex drink, after squeezing the lime, drop it into the serving glass and muddle it to release the citrus oil from the rind. Remove the fruit before adding the other ingredients.\nWhat\'s the History of the Cuba Libre?\nThere are several competing stories as to how this cocktail came to be, but one thing for sure is that it didn\'t happen until after Coca-Cola arrived in Cuba around 1900. A popular version of the drink\'s origin is that it was invented at the American Bar in Havana, where a group of American soldiers was celebrating the defeat over the Spanish in the Spanish-American war. A Captain of the U.S. Army ordered Bacardi rum with Coca-Cola and a lime wedge and toasted ""Por Cuba libre!"", which was a popular wartime rally cry. The phrase instantly became the name for the cocktail.\n\nCoca-Cola soon realized the soda\'s popularity in Cuba and set up a bottling plant in 1906. When the U.S. placed an embargo on Coca-Cola exports to Cuba in 1960, Cubans began making Cuba libres with TuKola instead.\nHow Strong Is a Cuba Libre?\nThe Cuba libre is a rather mild mixed drink. Its actual alcohol content will vary depending on the strength of your rum and the amount of cola you end up pouring. On average, though, it will mix up to just 11 percent ABV (22 proof). That\'s perfectly normal for highball drinks and about as strong as a glass of wine.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cuba-libre-recipe-759291

Use the cleanest water possible and avoid using ice that has been in the freezer for too long or near foods with heavy aromas, such as fish.\nThe godfather is a perfect drink for ice balls or large cubes. These will melt more slowly than standard ice cubes and prevent an overly diluted drink.\nRecipe Variations\nThis version of the godfather uses a 3-to-1 ratio of Scotch whisky to amaretto. This produces a sweet drink but not as cloying as the 1-to-1 ratio suggested by one popular amaretto producer. For even less sweetness, pour 2 ounces of scotch with 1/2 ounce of amaretto.\nThe godmother is essentially the same cocktail, opting for vodka over scotch.\nThe godchild switches to cognac.\nFor a goddaughter, mix up a godmother and pour equal amounts of amaretto and cream.\nWhy Is It Called a Godfather Cocktail?\nThe origins of the drink are murky, but it debuted around the same time as the Oscar-winning film, ""The Godfather."" In the movie, scotch is regularly enjoyed, and amaretto, which was widely used in cocktails during the 1970s, has Italian roots. It was only logical that someone made the connection between the movie and the drink. With its slow-sipping feel, one can easily imagine it as a drink Don Corleone might have at his desk while considering favors on his daughter\'s wedding day.\nHow Strong Is the Godfather?\nThe godfather is a stiff drink because it is made entirely of alcohol. Generally, it\'s a little softer than the whisky you pour. For instance, when made with an 80-proof Scotch whisky and 50-proof amaretto, its alcohol content will fall around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).\nWhiskey Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/godfather-cocktail-recipe-761446

Top with chilled mineral water.\nGarnish with a lime wedge.\nTips\nRanch water is typically made with blanco tequila. For the best tasting drink, choose a mid-range 100% agave tequila as it will have the crispest, purest tequila flavor.\nWhile fresh lime juice is essential to ranch water, the exact amount is a personal preference. Some drinkers go rather light and squeeze just a quarter of a lime into the drink while others enjoy the intensity of an entire lime. When experimenting, start small, mix the drink, and add more until it reaches your ideal flavor.\nRecipe Variations\nReposado tequila is a nice alternative to blanco and adds a subtle oak flavor to ranch water. Mezcal is also an interesting choice that gives the drink a deep complexity without sacrificing refreshment.\nRanch water is often sweetened with agave nectar (a teaspoon or two will do). You can also go sugar-free with keto simple syrup or add a little spice with jalape?o simple syrup.\nMany bars make ranch water with an orange liqueur like Cointreau. Try it with about 1/2 ounce of liqueur for a hint of sweet citrus.\nA splash of another citrus juice?particularly grapefruit or orange?is a great way to subtly boost ranch water's flavor. Alternatively, use citrus-flavored mineral water.\nMake nonalcoholic ranch water by switching to a zero-proof tequila spirit. The flavor is similar to regular tequila, though it may require more lime or a sweetener.\nA tequila soda is very similar to ranch water but uses club soda. Ginger ale and lemon-lime sodas will create a slightly sweeter tequila highball.\nHow Strong Is Ranch Water?\nDespite the inclusion of tequila, ranch water is a refreshingly light cocktail. On average, the drink's strength falls in the 9 percent alcohol by volume (ABV. 18 proof) range. That's just between beer and wine, and it's even lighter if you use the entire bottle of mineral water.\nPineapple Tequila Mixed Drink""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ranch-water-recipe-5216820

Stir gently.\nGarnish with a lime wedge. Serve and enjoy.\nWhat Exactly Is Ginger Beer?\nFor starters, it's not a beer. This nonalcoholic beverage was indeed similar to a beer when it originated in England in the late 1800s. Like a fizzy cider, it was alcoholic, thus the name. But the beverage has transformed into a lightly sparkly sweet drink, powerfully flavored with ginger.\n\nThis carbonated and yeast-fermented drink is great on its own, but best when mixed with liquors like gin, vodka, tequila, or rum. From these combinations, many variations on the mule cocktail have been born, all delightful thanks to the powerful punch of the ginger beer.\nOther Gin Cocktails With Soda\nThere are a few other gin highballs that combine gin and soda that you will also want to try:\nThe gin-gin mule is a modern cocktail created by Audrey Saunders. For this one, you'll muddle a lime wedge with mint and syrup, add gin, then top it with ginger beer.\nThe leapfrog cocktail is the same as the foghorn but uses lemon instead of lime juice.\nThe gin rickey skips the ginger beverages completely and opts for club soda instead.\nTo make a dragonfly, or Prohibition cocktail, skip the lime juice and use champagne instead of the soda.\nHow Strong Is the Foghorn?\nLike most gin and soda drinks, the foghorn is relatively mild when compared to other cocktails. With an 80-proof gin and served as a lowball, this drink has an alcohol content around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). If it's served tall and you double the soda, it becomes a tame 9 percent ABV (18 proof). ""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/foghorn-cocktail-recipe-760023

For the garnish, you\'ll also need to hunt down canned lychees, which have the fruit\'s hull removed and are packaged in a syrup. The syrup is not the best substitute for a juice, though.\nAs an alternative, mix up the martini with a lychee liqueur.

Top with the ginger ale.\nPlace the lime twist into the top center of the orange wheel and float on top of the drink.\nThe 'Pumpkin' Garnish\nThe jack-o'-lantern garnish is one of the easiest garnishes you can make. You can create a bunch of pumpkin tops in advance of a party; simply refrigerate the completed garnishes until they're needed.\nMake sure to choose a large enough glass that can fit the orange wheel. You'll likely need a double rocks (old-fashioned) glass to get the diameter needed for an average orange. You can also select smaller oranges specifically for this drink.\nKeep in mind that you need a little room around the orange so it does not block the drink from pouring out. If your orange does touch the rim, you can always insert a thin sipping straw down the side. This should let you enjoy the drink while keeping your pumpkin intact.\nFor the lime, cut a long twist from the peel, then cut it into small sections to create the stems for multiple drinks. The other option is to simply cut strips of lime peel and forget the spiral. Either way, it will look great and should poke right into the center of the orange wheel.\nTips\nEvery cocktail needs to be customized to suit your personal taste and the jack-o'-lantern is no different. The recipe is a good starting point that puts more focus on the cognac and ginger ale, leaving the orange ingredients as a background flavor. \nThis may still be too much orange juice for some people, so you may want to back off a little more on it, depending on the juice you are using. This ratio works rather well with fresh-squeezed orange juice that has the pulp removed. If you choose a store-bought orange juice with a more concentrated flavor, you may want to pour only 1/2 to 3/4 ounce.\nYou can also customize the amount of ginger ale. If you find the drink to be a little orange heavy, simply add more soda after the first few sips to give the drink a little more life.\nHow Strong Is a Jack-O'-Lantern?\nAs you make adjustments to the recipe, its alcohol content will change slightly.

Many bottled juices include a sweetener and that will make the dulce de tequila too sweet. Since a lime typically yields 1 ounce of juice, you should be fine squeezing half a lime directly into the shaker.\nSuperfine sugar has finer granules than regular white sugar and is often preferred for rimming because of its more delicate texture. There's no need to hunt it down at the store, though. With the help of a food processor, you can quickly make superfine sugar at home.\nThis recipe originally suggested only a lemon wedge as the garnish. That's unusual since lime is used in the recipe. If you want to get the most out of a single fruit, cut a lime in half, using one piece for the juice and the other to create a wedge for the garnish.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you are going to substitute any of the suggested liquors for another brand, be sure to choose spirits of equal quality. This cocktail has an amazing taste, but downgrading even one element will quickly take it from great to OK.\nNot everyone is a fan of sugar rims. It completes this cocktail's experience, though.

For instance, it's tasty with raspberry and kiwi infused blanco tequila, though you could also play with a variety of fruit combinations.\nIf desired, the glass can be rimmed in salt. Simply take the chilled glass, run a bit of lime around the rim and dip the rim in a small plate filled with kosher salt. Fill glass with ice, then add the prepared cocktail. Garnish with lime.\nWhat's the Best Way to Serve a Margarita?\nLike any margarita, you have a few choices when it comes to serving the Hpnotiq margarita. Each style has its appeal:\nMargaritas are most often served up in a margarita or cocktail glass. This offers the full-flavored taste of the drink and a stunning presentation. It's best if the glass is nice and frosty before straining the drink.\nFor a flavor that mellows as you drink, serve it on the rocks in a large old-fashioned glass. The recipe's volume makes it a nice candidate for an ice-filled Mason jar as well.\nWhen you're in the mood for a boozy slushy, toss the ingredients in a blender with 3/4 to 1 cup of ice.\nHow Strong Is a Hpnotiq Margarita?\nNot only is this margarita beautiful and fruity, but it also has a pleasant strength. Hpnotiq is a 34-proof liqueur, which is similar to the average triple sec. Combine those with an 80-proof tequila, and the margarita mixes up to around 19 percent ABV (36 proof). That's a little lighter than the original margarita but still pretty strong and the sweet, fruity taste can be deceiving.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hpnotiq-margarita-recipe-760829

If desired, add a few dashes of orange bitters.\nStir well for at least 30 seconds.\nGarnish with a lime slice.\nTip\nShake the Incredible Hulk with ice and strain it over fresh ice to soften and better blend the flavors.\nRecipe Variations\nFor a sweeter and greener cocktail, switch to a 2-to-1 ratio: Mix three ounces of Hpnotiq with 1 1/2 ounces of cognac.\nTo fill a pitcher or punch bowl, increase the two ingredients in the desired proportions. Add lots of ice, and keep chilled until time to serve. For instance, for six drinks at the 1-to-1 ratio, mix 1 1/2 cups of each of the two liquors, and be generous with the bitters.\nLighten up the flavor and potency of the drink by serving it in a highball glass and topping it with club soda. It\'s a good idea when making the punch versions as well.\nCreate a frozen Incredible Hulk by tossing the ingredients into a blender with 1 cup of crushed ice and blend until smooth.\nYou can even make Incredible Hulk jello shots: Combine 1/2 cup cold water with 1/4 cup each of cognac and Hpnotiq, and chill. Dissolve a three-ounce box of lime jello into one cup of boiling water. Stir together the hot and cold mixtures, pour into molds, and refrigerate until set.\nWhat Are Bitters?\nIn the drink world, ""bitters"" are concentrated flavor enhancers typically used by the dash. Made by infusing various botanicals (herbs, fruits, spices, and roots) into alcohol, they give a subtle (and welcomed) flavor boost to cocktails. Aromatic and orange bitters are used most often, but bitters are available in a variety of flavors that are fun to experiment with and can often be interchanged.\nWhat Kind of Cognac Should I Use?\nThere\'s no need to use an expensive cognac in a sweeter drink like the Incredible Hulk. Keep the good stuff for sipping straight, and save some money by pouring a good mid-range cognac. You can also use regular brandy as a substitute.\nHow Strong Is an Incredible Hulk Cocktail?\nThe Incredible Hulk cocktail is as strong as its namesake. This short drink mixes up to around 21 percent ABV (42 proof), placing it right up there with the average martini. To put that into perspective, drinking two of these is equivalent to a straight shot of brandy.\nHpnotiq Margarita']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/incredible-hulk-drink-recipe-5201295

If needed, strain a second time to remove all of the leaves.\nWhich Tea Should You Choose?\nWhile it may be tempting to use ordinary bags of generic green tea for your vodka, the choice may leave you disappointed. Instead, choose a good loose-leaf green tea. There are many styles?from jasmine green tea to Dragonwell green tea?to choose from and it\'s difficult to pick a bad one if they\'re quality leaves.\nYou might also choose a flavored green tea such as a yuzu sencha blend (this is highly recommended).\nDepending on the tea, you may need to adjust the infusion time. Give it a small taste test every 2 to 3 hours until you find the flavor you enjoy most.\nSweeten Your Vodka Into a Green Tea Liqueur\nMuch like sweetening iced tea, green tea vodka can be sweetened slightly to create a liqueur. You may find that you enjoy this more with certain types of tea if they come off too bitter in the alcohol.\nTo do this, you will simply add a small amount of simple syrup to the finished vodka infusion. It can be done immediately after the infusion or when you\'ve had some time to taste the infusion on its own.\nBegin with 1 tablespoon of syrup for 750 milliliters of vodka.

There's no point in wasting a full bottle if it won't work for your needs.\nHow Black Are the Cocktails?\nIf you are trying to bring a non-black drink into the darkness, do some experiments first to see if it will give you the look you're going for. Depending on the mixers in the drink and their proportions, this black vodka should, in the least, turn it a darker hue. It is not guaranteed to turn the entire drink black.\nMore DIY Black Vodka Options\nThere are a few other options that you might want to consider, though not all are as quick or cheap as the food coloring formula. None of these produce the perfect black vodka that is Blavod. It uses a black catechu bark infusion; the dried herb is difficult to come by and hardly worth the expense and effort. You do have some alternative options:\nUse black gel food coloring. It's sold at specialty baking shops and online and is commonly used to make black cake frosting. Begin with just a small amount, shake the vodka, and see how it works. It likely won't separate like the liquid coloring unless you add too much.\nDo a vodka infusion with black rice. Also called forbidden rice, it's expensive and can be found at specialty markets and online. Once you have the rice, simply infuse it into a bottle of vodka. Use about 1 cup of rice per bottle, shake it daily, and plan on at least three days for the infusion; you should be able to easily gauge the results. Strain the rice when it reaches the desired color and re-bottle the vodka. This method results in a vodka that has a nice, black color and the taste is unaffected. You also don't have to worry much about colors settling, though shaking the bottle before each pour is still a good idea.\nWill Activated Charcoal Make Black Vodka?\nActivated charcoal supplements have been suggested as a way to make black vodka. It's not as good as the rice or food coloring options because the charcoal settles significantly and the vodka will become grey. Contrary to rumors, activated charcoal doesn't lower blood alcohol levels1, so don't think it will reduce your hangover chances, either.\n\nAlso, be aware that activated charcoal can negatively interact with some medications. Unlike other toxins, the charcoal doesn't bind to alcohol and the two together may cause gastrointestinal problems as well as serious health risks like a pulmonary aspiration2. This black vodka hack is not worth the risks and, as a responsible drinker, it's best to go with safer options.\nUsing Black Vodka in Cocktails\nYou can play around with black vodka in nearly any vodka cocktail. Since you're only altering the appearance and not the taste, you shouldn't notice much of a difference.\n\nThe cocktail recipes that call for black vodka are often as much a novelty as the liquor itself. Try the black and gold, a martini-style drink with Goldschlager, or the black widow, a simple twist on the vodka-cranberry. For a party shot, you might want to try the black rose. If you don't like the sweet, pink liqueur known as Tequila Rose, try Irish cream instead.\nLemon Infused Vodka Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-black-vodka-760327

Use the pepper whole or cut it in half, removing all seeds and most of the white flesh.\nPlace the garlic and habanero pepper into a clean quart-sized Mason jar. \nFill the jar with vodka. Secure the lid on the jar and shake well.\nStore the infusion in a cool, dark place for 3 to 5 hours. Taste it after 3 hours, then every 1/2 hour after that until you get the desired flavor.\nStrain the vodka through a fine-mesh strainer, coffee filter, or cheesecloth and into a separate container. Store as you would any other vodka.\nUse in your favorite drinks, and enjoy.\nTips\nMake sure that any time you handle hot peppers that you wash your hands thoroughly!\nInfusion Tip: A 1-quart jar will hold a 750 ml bottle of vodka with extra room for the infusion ingredients. The Mason jar with a wide mouth makes it easy to get the ingredients in and out. Keep the original liquor bottle to store your finished vodka and label it with the flavor.\nIt is not recommended to use a chile pepper that is hotter than a habanero. Save those ghost peppers for food, this is a drink! Drinking spicy peppers is a different experience than eating them and too much heat really is too much. This is not your taco that has savory ingredients to absorb the heat!\nRecipe Variation\nTry this infusion with tequila.\nAdjusting the Spice of the Vodka Infusion\nIn the scope of hot peppers cultivated today, the habanero is no longer the hottest though it is still very hot. It's important to keep the pepper's flavor in check or you will not be able to drink the finished vodka (no amount of tomato juice could save some of this recipe's experiments). \nFor this reason, it's important to consider these factors and options before tossing a pepper in your infusion...\nUse a whole pepper or remove the seeds and white flesh. The white flesh inside a chile pepper holds the most capsaicin, which is where the pepper gets most of its heat. When the flesh comes in contact with your vodka, it will become very hot very fast. To control the heat, I like to keep the pepper whole. If you do cut the pepper, be sure to remove all the seeds (they're difficult to strain) and most of that white membrane.\nReduce the pepper infusion. Another trick for controlling the vodka's heat is to concentrate on the garlic flavor and reduce the infusion time on the pepper. You can do this two ways:\nBegin with both garlic and pepper and remove the pepper when the vodka is hot enough. Allow the garlic to continue infusing until you find the perfect balance of flavor.\nBegin with garlic alone and add the pepper once you get a nice garlic flavor. Taste the infusion every half hour (more often towards the end) until the spice is where you want it.\nChoose a milder pepper. This seems like an obvious solution, but it is worth mentioning. While the recipe recommends a habanero, you may not want to start with that. Jalapeno peppers have a great flavor that pairs well with garlic and almost any chile pepper will make a good substitution. \nHow to Drink Your Spicy Vodka\nA few words of caution: you may not want to drink this vodka straight as it can be rather intense. On the rocks is okay but caution should be taken with that as well. \nHowever, if you are looking to make a great Bloody Mary (or similar savory cocktail), this is a perfect choice. You also don't need to worry about the hot sauce because the habanero takes care of the spice!\nLemon Infused Vodka Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spicy-garlic-habanero-vodka-recipe-760712

Seal, shake, and let infuse for 4 to 7 days. Shake the jar daily and test the infusion after the third or fourth day to see how the flavor develops.\nOnce the infusion reaches your desired flavor intensity, strain out and discard the lemon peels using a fine-mesh strainer.\nBottle the lemon vodka under a tight seal. Store in a cool, dark place as you would other liquors, and use in your favorite drinks.\nTips\nUse large lemon peels (rather than zested lemon) to make straining the vodka easy. A vegetable peeler is an excellent way to quickly get peels from a lemon without the bitter pith, and you can juice the remaining fruit for another use to avoid waste.\nOrganic fruits are preferred because the fruit doesn\'t have a waxy peel and is not treated with chemicals while growing in the grove. If you use non-organic fruit, be sure to scrub the peels thoroughly under running water.\nDon\'t worry too much about getting a precise measurement of lemon peel. Instead, peel two average-sized lemons and infuse the vodka a bit longer if the fruits yield less peel or reduce the infusion time for very large lemons. No matter how much you use, tasting a little of the vodka daily is essential.\nThe best vodka infusions begin with decent vodka. Choose a brand that you enjoy drinking on its own or mixing in with your favorite vodka cocktails. There are several smooth-tasting options among budget-friendly vodkas that are excellent candidates for infusions.\nRecipe Variations\nSeveral commercial citrus-infused vodkas are gently sweetened and bottled slightly lower (typically 35 percent ABV or 70 proof) than regular vodka. A little syrup can balance out the tartness of a straight citrus infusion and lower the alcohol content. To soften your homemade 80-proof citrus vodka to this strength, make a light simple syrup using two parts water and one part sugar and add 5 ounces or so (about 2/3 cup) to the strained vodka until it reaches your desired taste. The sweetened vodka may be a bit cloudy after adding the syrup.\nYou can make citrus vodka using other fruits; lime, orange, and grapefruit are great options. Orange is a bit sweeter and less tart than lemons, so you might want to extend the infusion. Lime and grapefruit are more bitter and will likely require just a couple of days to infuse.\nHave fun experimenting with a combination of citrus fruits. For instance, many commercial vodkas that are simply labeled ""citrus"" are a blend of several fruit peels. Try a combination of lemon, lime, and orange for a well-balanced and interesting vodka infusion.\nHow Strong Is Lemon-Infused Vodka?\nThis lemon vodka will be the same strength as the vodka you used to make it. The majority are 40 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 80 proof). If you choose to use a high-proof vodka (100 proof is most common), the vodka will obviously be stronger and the extra alcohol will intensify the lemon flavor, so you might want to reduce the infusion time.\nHow to Use and Serve Lemon-Infused Vodka\nThe homemade lemon vodka has a bright, tart taste that\'s excellent as a sipper, shot, or served on the rocks. You can also pour your lemon vodka into any cocktail recipe that calls for citrus vodka or other vodka drinks that could use the fresh flavor boost. It\'s best with soda and juice highballs?from the vodka tonic to the madras?and is a fun addition to fruity martinis such as the lemon drop.\nHow to Store Homemade Citrus Vodka\nThe homemade lemon vodka will last as long as other vodkas. When stored properly?in a cool, dark place as you would any liquor?it has an indefinite shelf life. If you choose to blend it with syrup, the vodka can still be stored at room temperature, but plan to drink it within six months to a year.\nHow Long Is Too Long to Infuse Vodka?\nWhen experimenting with vodka infusions, the taste is the biggest factor and the indication on when it\'s time to strain the liquor. The length of time that any vodka needs to be infused depends primarily on the flavoring ingredient. For instance, citrus peels are full of flavor, so they require a shorter infusion time than a milder fruit like pineapple. If you let any infusion go for too long, the flavor can become overpowering, which is why it\'s crucial to test the infusion throughout the process to develop a balance of flavor that works in cocktails.\nCan You Eat the Fruit From Infused Vodka?\nIn many instances, you can eat the fruit used in liquor infusions. Sometimes?as in the case of this pear cobbler cocktail?it\'s desirable and the boozy fruit can make a tasty treat. However, there are not many great uses for the citrus peels used in this recipe (and they\'re not fun to eat), so it\'s best to discard them.\nThe 10 Best Cheap Vodkas in 2022\nLavender-Rosemary Infused Vodka']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/citrus-lemon-infused-vodka-recipe-5209622

If you're not having any luck, there are a couple of substitutes:\nBlackberry Brandy: Many of today's fruit-flavored brandies include sugar, making them more of a liqueur than a true brandy. That's quite convenient because it makes blackberry brandy a viable substitution for the bramble's cr?me de m?re.\nBlack Raspberry Liqueur: Blackberries and black raspberries have a very similar flavor, as do the liqueurs made from the two fruits. That means you can get away with using a black raspberry liqueur such as the popular Chambord.\nHow Strong Is a Bramble Cocktail?\nThe bramble is neither the strongest nor the weakest cocktail you can mix up.

Fill with ice.\nShake vigorously and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with two blackberries or raspberries. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nDark grape juice is designated in the recipe because there is a ""white"" version of the fruit juice available (it actually looks like apple juice). While the blood martini will taste the same with it, you will lose the bloody effect.\nThe ginger liqueur adds a real spark to the taste of this drink. When choosing one, try to match the quality of Ketel One. Domaine de Canton is a great option that\'s easy to find, and The King\'s Ginger has a brilliant kick that would do very well here too.\nBlackberry syrup is relatively common and a number of beverage syrup makers offer it, so it may be available at your local grocer. You might also find it around the pancake syrups.\nAlternatively, you can make your own blackberry syrup at home. It\'s incredibly easy, should take about 15 minutes, and requires 1 cup of blackberries with a little sugar and water.\nRecipe Variation\nRather than the syrup, pour a blackberry liqueur instead. Bols and Marie Brizard both make the liqueur. There are others, though this is not the most common liqueur flavor, so the choices are slim. In a pinch, try Chambord (it\'s very easy to find). It\'s made with black raspberries and has a deep purple color as well.\nHow Strong Is a Blood Martini?\nKetel One\'s flavored vodkas are really nice because they\'re bottled at a full 80-proof (most are just 70-proof). That higher alcohol content produces a more pronounced flavor and contributes to the blood martini\'s strength. It should weigh in around 20 percent ABV (40 proof), or about the same as a cosmopolitan.\nBlackberry Mojito']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blood-martini-recipe-760939

Be sure to let them thaw a little so they can be mashed.\nWith the abundance of fresh fruits, this mojito will be best with fresh lime juice as well. You should be able to squeeze half a lime directly into the shaker to get the 1/2 ounce needed for the recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nPouring an aged or spiced rum will create more of a flavor foundation that can be quite nice.\nUse any other lightly flavored soda as an alternative to club soda. Citrus sodas and ginger ales will result in a sweeter drink that's equally refreshing. You could even use a slightly flavored sparkling water, such as La Croix, playing up the fruits if you prefer.\nSwitch to other seasonal fruits if you like. Use blueberries or strawberries, or go with other melons like cantaloupe or honeydew.\nHow Strong Is an Independence Day Mojito?\nShellback Silver is an 80-proof rum, and since it's the only liquor, this mojito is going to be a relatively light drink.

Muddle well to mash the fruits and dissolve the sugar.\nAdd the rum.\nFill the glass with ice cubes and top with club soda.\nGarnish with a few blackberries, the lime wheel, a sprig of fresh mint, and serve.\nTips\nMuddling is the bartending technique of mashing fruits, herbs, and other fresh produce with a muddler to release their flavors. It's often done with sugar or a splash of liquid before the liquor and other ingredients are added to the drink. If you don't have a muddler, a spoon will work, though it's not quite as efficient.\nBlackberries will stain wood and other porous surfaces. If possible, avoid using a wood muddler for this drink or wash it immediately with warm, soapy water.\nLight rum is the most common choice for any mojito. Aged rum adds a darker, oaky foundation that pairs well with this recipe's blackberries. No matter which style you choose, the best rum for a mojito is mid- to top-shelf, preferably one that you enjoy drinking on its own or in other cocktails.\nMake two or three drinks at once by lining up the glasses and working your way down the line as you complete each step.\nRecipe Variations\nDouble up on the blackberry flavor by adding 1/2 ounce of cr?me de m?re or another blackberry liqueur. If you don't have fresh blackberries, pour a full ounce of the berry liqueur.\nSwitch from rum to vodka if that's your liquor of choice. Flavored vodkas are fun in this mojito as well; blackberry pairs well with other berries, peach, and vanilla.\nTo make a pitcher of mojitos, it's easiest to use a mint simple syrup and lime juice. Mash a cup or so of blackberries in the pitcher, then add 1 1/2 cups light rum, 1 to 1 1/2 cups each of mint syrup and fresh lime juice, and about 2 cups of club soda.\nFor a nonalcoholic blackberry mojito, skip the rum and add more soda. Switch to a sweeter soda, such as ginger ale, if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Blackberry Mojito?\nMuddling blackberries adds a lot of juice to the cocktail, and that keeps the alcohol content in check. On average, with an 80-proof rum, this blackberry mojito should be in the 11 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 22 proof) range. That's normal for a mojito and similar to drinking a glass of wine.\nWhat Can You Use Instead of Mint in a Mojito?\nBlackberries don't pair well with other types of herbs, so mint really is your best option in a blackberry mojito. If you need to preserve fresh mint before it wilts, capture its cool taste in a mint syrup.

One orange will yield enough juice for two or three creamsicles.\nHalf-and-half is not as thick as cream or as light as milk, though either makes a good substitute in this cocktail. (One made with milk would technically be called a dreamsicle.) For dairy-free alternatives, try vanilla-flavored soy or almond milk.\nRecipe Variations\nStrain the orange creamsicle into a cocktail glass. If you like, top it with a little whipped cream.\nTriple sec is not essential, though it is a nice sweetener. Skip it if you don't have it in stock or switch to an orange-flavored vodka.\nAdd more orange juice and half-and-half (2 to 3 ounces each) to make a taller drink. Serve it on the rocks in a collins glass.\nEnjoy a frozen creamsicle: Blend the recipe's vodka, triple sec, and orange juice with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or orange sherbet. Add a few ice cubes to give it more of a frozen margarita consistency; use 1 cup of ice when using half-and-half instead of ice cream.\nMake a simple orange creamsicle: Pour 1 1/2 ounces each of vodka and cream liqueur (e.g., Irish cream or RumChata) in a tall glass filled with ice. Top it off with orange soda.\nTransform this cocktail into a creamsicle float: Pour 1 1/2 ounces of vodka and 1/2 ounce of triple sec into a chilled glass.

With the softer foundation from a 70-proof flavored vodka, the original creamsicle shakes up to about 15 percent ABV (30 proof). That's a bit stronger than a glass of wine.

Alternatively, you can use a blender if you don\'t have a shaker.\nStrain into an old-fashioned glass and sprinkle the bitters on top of the foam. Serve immediately and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk for foodborne illness.\nTips\nTo get the most authentic version of this classic Peruvian cocktail, be sure to heed the following tips: \nSince this is a Peruvian-style pisco sour, pisco from Peru is preferred. Pisco puro is the traditional choice (made using only the Quebranta grape), but pisco acholado (a mixture of different grape varieties) will also work nicely. Pisco can be found in liquor stores across the U.S. and ordered online.\nVery tart lime juice is essential. Many recipes call for lemon juice, possibly a translation error from the Spanish word limon. Limones are actually small South American limes, similar to key limes (also known as ""Peruvian lemons"").\nThe skin of limes has a lot of essential oils that can be a tad too bitter and sour; when squeezing the lime, be sure to keep the flesh side facing down so the juice doesn\'t run over the lime peel. Avoid dropping the lime in as garnish as it will also tamper with the taste. \nKeep the simple syrup really simple. You can use any recipe for simple syrup you want, but the easiest and yummiest option is to do a basic 1:1 ratio of white sugar to water. \nIf possible, use a real egg white. You can always use pasteurized liquid egg whites from a container, but the texture is not quite the same and can affect the look and taste of an authentic pisco sour.\nShake your cocktail well so that when you pour it into an old-fashioned glass, you get a nice 1/2-inch layer of foam on top.\nIn Peru, Amargo Chuncho Bitters are preferred. Its international availability is increasing, though Angostura Aromatic Bitters has long been the recommended substitute.\nRecipe Variations\nAs the pisco sour gained worldwide attention, bartenders developed variations and explored techniques for mixing up this cocktail:\nIf you find that the shaken cocktail isn\'t producing the desired thickness of the foam, try the dry shake method: Shake the ingredients thoroughly without ice first, then fill the shaker with ice and shake very hard for at least 30 seconds before straining.\nLemon juice often replaces the key lime juice. Some drinkers prefer the switch in citrus while others find it a better match for certain types of pisco.\nDon\'t stress if you don\'t have bitters on hand, you can do without. Instead, you can try a sprinkle of grated cinnamon or nutmeg on top of the foam.\nTropical fruits make an excellent addition to the pisco sour. For instance, a mango pisco sour is a blended variation with frozen mango, and the maracuy? sour adds passion fruit juice.\nIs the Pisco Sour Safe to Drink?\nIt is safe for most people to drink a pisco sour, though any drink that includes raw eggs poses the risk of salmonella. Always take steps to make egg cocktails safely: Only use fresh, refrigerated eggs and be careful that the egg white does not touch the outer shell. You can also wait a little longer to take that first sip: A Brazilian study that intentionally inoculated a pisco sour with the bacteria found it safe to drink nine minutes after making the drink.1\nWho Created the Pisco Sour?\nThe pisco sour\'s exact history is disputed; both Chile and Peru lay claims to this famous cocktail\'s creation. However, the generally accepted story is that it was created sometime between 1915 and 1925. This account gives credit to bartender Victor Morris, an American bartender who was working in Lima, Peru at the time. It is a classically-styled sour drink, likely influenced by cocktails such as the whiskey sour.\nHow Strong Is a Pisco Sour?\nPeruvian pisco can range from 38 to 48 percent ABV and is the only alcohol in a pisco sour. Thanks to the mixers and a generous shake with ice, the cocktail is relatively light. When made with a 40 percent ABV (or 80 proof) pisco is used, this recipe will yield a cocktail with about 11 percent ABV, similar to a glass of red wine.\nChilcano de Pisco: A Peruvian Brandy Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/clasico-pisco-sour-cocktail-recipe-3029217

It can also be made in any style of glass and it\'s commonly served in stemmed glassware, such as a white wine glass. For a shorter drink, pick up your favorite old-fashioned glass.\nAdjust the Ratios to Your Taste\nAdjust the ratio of Aperol and prosecco to suit your taste. The recipe uses the popular 3:2:1 ratio, while some fans of the drink enjoy it with equal parts of liqueur and wine.\nIt\'s not traditional, but a shot of top-shelf vodka?particularly citrus vodka?is a nice addition to this drink.\nHow Strong Is an Aperol Spritz?\nAperol is bottled at 11 percent ABV (22 proof), so it\'s the same strength as the average prosecco. When the two come together in the Aperol spritz, the drink\'s alcohol content is around 8 percent ABV (16 proof). If you\'d like to make it lighter, pour less Aperol and wine and make up the difference with soda.\nWhen Was Aperol Created?\nThe Italian liqueur was developed by brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri after they inherited a liqueur company from their father in 1912. The story says that it took them seven years to perfect the recipe and Aperol was officially released in 1919. Over the next few decades, it gained popularity in Italy. Ap?ritivos are part of Italian dinner traditions and the brand became known for fashionable and eye-catching marketing campaigns with poster artwork that rivaled Campari\'s iconic advertisements. The Aperol spritz was created in the 1950s and saw a revival in the early 2000s as drinkers worldwide rediscovered its captivating taste. Appropriately, the Aperol brand is owned today by the Campari Group.\nWhat Kind of Alcohol Is Aperol?\nAperol is a unique distilled spirit that doesn\'t conveniently fit into a single category of liquor. The label calls it a liqueur, though it\'s not sweet like other orange liqueurs such as Cointreau and Grand Marnier. Instead, it follows the flavor profile of an ap?ritif?bitter, herbal, and dry. Adding to the confusion, the recipe for Aperol is a tightly guarded secret; officially, it\'s an infusion of oranges and ""selected herbs and roots."" Sweet and bitter oranges and rhubarb are known ingredients, and it may include gentian and cinchona as well. Whatever goes into it, the orange-colored liqueur has a zesty, bittersweet orange taste with herbal and woody accents. It\'s comparable to Campari but distinctly different; Aperol is citrus-forward, lighter in flavor, and not as bitter.\nInfuse Aperol With Thai Chili Pepper for a Spicy Paloma']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/aperol-spritz-cocktail-recipe-759259

Slicing the fruit speeds up the mashing process, too.\nUse either fresh or frozen strawberries for this cocktail. Frozen fruit is a great choice for the blended version (use about 1/2 cup), while fresh strawberries are excellent for the shaken daiquiri.\nFor the shaken strawberry daiquiri, serve it ""up"" or over fresh ice, but be sure to start out with a chilled cocktail or margarita glass. Since fresh strawberries are recommended, you will find it best to fine strain this cocktail. To do so, simply place a fine-mesh strainer over your glass as you\'re straining. This will keep most of the strawberry chunks and tiny seeds out of your drink.\nMix this drink with your favorite rum, any budget-friendly brand works well as the heavy fruit flavor means you don\'t need the best rum to achieve a wonderful character.\nIf your frozen drink is too thin, add a little more ice and blend again. Too thick? Add a splash of liquid and blend.\nWonderful Additions and Substitutions\nUse a strawberry liqueur in the shaken version instead of fresh berries. Begin with 1 ounce of liqueur and adjust it to suit your taste.\nUse a spiced rum in the daiquiri. Aged rum is also a good substitution, or add an extra 1/2 ounce of dark rum along with the light rum.\nGive the drink a boost of fruit flavor by adding 1/2 ounce of an orange liqueur?such as Cointreau?or elderflower or ginger liqueurs for a nice character.\nAdd herbs like basil, mint, and rosemary, all of which pair perfectly with strawberries. They can be incorporated into the muddle or blender, or you can use a flavored simple syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Strawberry Daiquiri?\nAdding a full cup of ice to the frozen strawberry daiquiri adds volume and creates a low-proof cocktail. Though it\'s just an estimate, the alcohol content should be around 8 percent ABV (16 proof). The shaken daiquiri is a little more potent and will fall in the range of 12 percent ABV (24 proof). While it is light, sweet drinks like this have to be consumed with caution, as their sugary flavor will make you ask for more.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/strawberry-daiquiri-recipes-759821

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nTip\nYou can vary the accent ingredients to suit your taste. Many people enjoy 3/4 ounce of Lillet Blanc and 1/2 ounce of lemon juice. Others up the lemon in the recipe to 3/4 ounce, keeping the other two at 1/2 ounce for a cocktail that's rather tart.\nHow Strong Is a Twentieth Century Cocktail?\nWhen it comes to the strength, this cocktail is a little lighter than the original gin martini and similar to other drinks of this style. It should shake up to 25 percent ABV (50 proof), which is pretty potent. Enjoy this one slowly and that shouldn't be an issue, though.\nRecipe Variation\nThere is another variation of the Twentieth Century cocktail that has the same flavor profile but makes a few changes to the ingredients. In this recipe, you can use Cocchi Americano rather than Lillet Blanc. The chocolate flavor comes from Amaro Meletti, an herbal digestif that is flavored with anise and saffron and still has a finished flavor reminiscent of chocolate. The chocolate mole bitters accent this aspect quite nicely.\nTo make it, shake 1 1/2 ounces of gin, 3/4 ounce of either Cocchi Americano or Lillet Blanc, 1/2 ounce of Amaro Meletti, and 1/4 ounce of lemon juice with a dash of Bittermen's Xocolatl Mole Bitters and ice.

Serve and enjoy.\nMake a Batch of Batter\nMix together 2 cups brown sugar, 1 cup unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon vanilla extract, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon each of ground nutmeg and allspice using an electric mixer until everything is blended together. You'll have enough batter for about 24 drinks.\nTo make a drink, pour a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of dark rum into a mug, add a tablespoon of the batter, then top it with hot water. For a slightly sweeter drink, add a teaspoon of honey.\nStore the batter in a well-sealed jar in the refrigerator until needed. It will be ready for the first drink after about an hour and keeps well for a few weeks. Many hot buttered rum fans prefer to form their batter into a log. This makes it easy to slice off one piece at a time whenever you want a drink. To do this, place the batter onto a sheet of plastic wrap and use it to shape a long roll that's about 2 inches thick. Wrap it up tightly, place it in an airtight container or plastic zip-close bag, and store it in the refrigerator; it will also freeze for up to three months.\nThe big-batch batter mix is fantastic on its own when topped with hot water. Skip the liquor entirely, add a little cream if you like, and 2 teaspoons of rum extract to one serving, and you'll have a warm, soothing mocktail.\nAlternate Mixing Method\nIf you're looking for a fun way to mix your hot buttered rum, try using a red hot poker. The heat naturally melds all the flavors together, creating a luscious, steaming drink. It is great for camping and can be used for caramelizing dark beer, too.\n\nIt takes some patience, so go slowly and take care not to burn yourself. Also, the thicker the glass, the better; heftier beer mugs with handles are perfect.\n\nChoose a clean, thick rod and let it sit in the fire until it is red hot. Shake off any ashes and slowly put it into the finished drink, being careful not to touch the glass with the rod or it will shatter.\n\nLeave it in for 10 or 15 seconds, remove the rod, and enjoy your hot drink.\nHow Strong Is Hot Buttered Rum?\nHot buttered rum is a gently spiked drink. Its alcohol content will be determined by how much water you pour. If you're precise in measuring 5 ounces of hot water and pour an 80-proof rum, the drink weighs in around 10 percent ABV (20 proof).

As seen in gin and vermouth, this quality often comes from the botanical ingredients included in the liquor or fortified wine. Though the ingredients are kept secret, Campari is made with ""bitter herbs, aromatic plants, and fruit,"" and is Italy\'s most famous aperitivo (Italian for the French word, aperitif). Any drink that includes it is naturally going to retain those characteristics. In the Campari and soda, those benefits are enhanced with the bubbly soda, and it will not dull the palate with sweeteners. Like a good wine pairing, it both allows you to fully enjoy the flavor of your food and enhances the dining experience.\nHow Strong Is the Campari and Soda?\nThe Campari and soda is a gentle drink. Two factors will affect the drink\'s strength: the amount of soda you pour and the bottling strength of the Campari (it varies by market). With the 3:1 mix and Campari sold in the U.S., the drink\'s alcohol content is about 6 percent ABV (12 proof) or similar to a strong beer.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/campari-and-soda-cocktail-759268

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe relies on a frozen, concentrated fruit punch, which is why the extra water is needed. If you prefer to go with a bottled fruit punch juice, skip the water and pour 2 cups of fruit punch. Add more until you find the perfect juice blend for your taste.\nDuring strawberry season, it's highly recommended to use fresh strawberries. You will want to mash them to release their juices, which can easily be done with a muddler. Alternatively, run the berries through your electric juicer. This gives the punch a fresher taste and creates a really nice drink for spring and summer parties.\nAdding the wine and soda at the very last minute ensures that your punch is as effervescent as possible.\nChill all of the ingredients ahead of time to make sure it's nice and cold before serving. By doing this, you can avoid adding ice and prevent watering down the flavor. Another option is to set the punch bowl in a high-walled tray or flat bowl filled with ice, refreshing it as it melts.\nThis recipe makes a rather large batch of punch?about 20 4-ounce servings. If your punch bowl cannot handle the volume, pour only half of the juice mix into the bowl at a time. Fill with an equal amount of ginger ale and Champagne, and reserve the rest to refill the bowl when it gets low.\nRecipe Variations\nChampagne is not your only option and you can choose your favorite sparkling wine. You will often find that the Italian Prosecco costs a little less, making it a perfect choice for sparkling punches on a budget.\nA punch recipe like this is the perfect candidate to create a fruity non-alcoholic punch that everyone can enjoy. Simply replace the wine with a sparkling grape juice or sparkling cider. The flavor will be nearly identical.\nHow Strong Is a Strawberry Champagne Punch?\nMost Champagnes and sparkling wines are in the 12 percent alcohol by volume range. Since that's the only alcohol in this very large punch, it's a pleasantly mild beverage to serve your guests. On average, the final alcohol content comes out to around 0.15 percent ABV, so the alcohol is barely detectable.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/strawberry-champagne-punch-recipe-4156274

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFresh lemon juice is highly recommended. The average lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces of juice, so one fruit is more than enough for a single drink.\nThe garnish can vary. Honeydew melon plays up Midori\'s flavoring (it\'s made with Yubari king melon and musk melon), and Midori\'s official recipe recommends a maraschino cherry. A slice of lemon or lime is a nice option as well.\nRecipe Variations\nMake this drink as tall as you like. For instance, you can double the recipe and serve it in a larger cocktail glass or on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass. Top that with a lightly flavored soda in a highball glass for a refreshing, sparkling drink.\nLime juice is sometimes used as a substitute for the lemon juice.\nSome drinkers prefer to replace the Cointreau with vodka. To retain a hint of extra flavor, pour a citrus vodka.\nTequila is another option and that variation is typically paired with lime juice (if you add sour mix, you\'ll have a melon margarita).\nWhy Is It Called a Japanese Slipper?\nMidori is a Japanese liqueur, produced by Suntory and flavored with the country\'s famous melons. The brand name also means ""green"" in Japanese. Since it is the key ingredient to the cocktail and a comforting, lovely mix, the name Japanese slipper is rather fitting. It\'s said that the recipe was created by Jean-Paul Bourguignon at Mietta\'s Restaurant in Melbourne, Australia. That was in 1984, just a few years after Midori was first released. It\'s hard to argue that this cocktail, which is seen as a modern classic, helped propel the liqueur to the fame it enjoys today.\nHow Strong Is a Japanese Slipper?\nLiqueurs tend to be lighter than liquors like vodka and whiskey, but that\'s not the case with Cointreau (or its orange-flavored counterpart, Grand Marnier). It\'s bottled at 80 proof, so the Japanese slipper is not as light as you might expect?it\'s not bad, though. This drink will mix up to 17 percent ABV (34 proof) or so, making it one of the lighter martini-style cocktails around.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/japanese-slipper-recipe-759710

This makes service much easier as all you need to do is place ice in the bowl, add your punch mix, then top it off with soda.\nQuick Measurements for Different Party Sizes\nTo make the conversion of this recipe easier, here are examples of how to mix the Midori Berry Bliss to serve as few or as many people as you need.\nThe conversions to the liquid measurements are only approximations and rounded either up or down. A little more or less of any ingredient will not throw off the balance of the punch (that's why this is such a great recipe).\nFor a Pitcher (creates about 11 servings at 4-ounces each):\n3/4-750ml bottle (19 ounces or 2 1/4 cups) Midori\n1/2-750ml bottle (12 3/4 ounces or 1 1/2 cups) vanilla vodka\n1/4-750ml bottle (6 1/4 ounces or 3/4 cup) raspberry vodka\n1 1/2-2 1/2 ounces pineapple juice (adjusted to taste)\n1 1/2-2 1/2 ounces soda water (adjusted to taste)\nFor a Single Cocktail (creates about a 4-ounce drink):\n1 1/2 ounces Midori\n1 ounce vanilla vodka\n1/2 ounce raspberry vodka\nSplash (about 1/8 ounce) of pineapple juice\nSplash of soda water\nHow to Make an Ice Ring\nWhile the recipe recommends filling a punch bowl with ice, consider creating an ice ring instead. Not only does this look better in the bowl, but the single mass of ice will melt slower than smaller pieces of ice. This prevents your punch from becoming overly diluted.\nIt's very easy to create an ice ring. All you need is a round mold and an extra day or two to ensure it's thoroughly frozen.\nUse a bundt cake pan or round gelatin mold with no center.\nFill the mold with distilled water.\nGive it at least 24-48 hours to freeze. Remember that it takes longer to freeze a larger volume of water.\nAdd cut strawberries or whole seasonal berries to the water before freezing to add a nice decoration to the punch.\nWhen removing the ring from the mold, you can break it free by dunking it in cool water (not hot) for about a minute. Then, hold the mold upside down over your empty punch bowl and gently tap it until it comes loose.\nHow Strong Is the Midori Berry Bliss?\nIt doesn't matter how much of this punch you are making, the volume doesn't affect the drink's strength. On average, with 35 percent ABV (70 proof) vodkas (typical for flavored vodkas), the Midori Berry Bliss weighs in around 21 percent ABV (42 proof).\n\nWhile it's not the mildest punch, it is also not very strong. If you'd like to tame it down a bit, add more soda (it really won't hurt the flavor).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/midori-berry-bliss-recipe-760962

You will come across many recipes that do not distinguish the liqueur, recommend a different liqueur, or have various ratios. To set the record straight, Galliano L\'Autentico is the liqueur that makes the proper Harvey Wallbanger. No other liqueurs can be successfully substituted in this cocktail.\nWhy Is it Called a Harvey Wallbanger?\nAs with many cocktails, there are a couple of claims to the creation of the Harvey Wallbanger. One is that it may have been created as an ""all I got left in the bar"" drink. Supposedly, the host of a party in the mid-60s had only vodka, orange juice, and Galliano available. After a couple of these drinks, a guest named Harvey was found to be banging his head against the wall and cursing the drink that caused him his misery. \n\nThat\'s a fun story, but it\'s not very believable. The accepted truth attributes the Harvey Wallbanger\'s creation to Donato ""Duke"" Antone who owned Duke\'s Blackwatch Bar in Hollywood. It was at this Sunset Boulevard joint in 1952 that Antone created the cocktail. He named it after a local surfer and bar regular named Tom Harvey.\n\nIt was not until the late 1960s that a marketing director for the company importing Galliano ""discovered"" the drink. George Bednar created a surfer-themed ad campaign with the tagline ""Harvey Wallbanger is the name, and I can be made!"" By the time the disco era began, the drink was on everyone\'s lips. The 70s may have been the cocktail\'s glory days, but little gems like the Harvey Wallbanger are unforgettable.\nHow Strong Is the Harvey Wallbanger?\nYou can make a few adjustments to the recipe and pour more vodka or less orange juice if you like, though there\'s a balance to the recipe as written. If you pour according to the recipe, the Harvey Wallbanger has an alcohol content of around 12 percent ABV (24 proof), which makes it about the same strength as a robust wine.\n70s Throwback Harvey Wallbanger Cake']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/harvey-wallbanger-recipe-759308

While Thomas intended the Japanese Cocktail to be made with it, there\'s no reason why you can\'t pour your favorite brandy, even if it\'s not made in Cognac.\nThere are a number of great options available and it\'s hard to choose a bad cognac for this drink. However, it would be best with a mid- to upper-level cognac or brandy. That\'s because this is a very simple drink and there\'s little to disguise a less than ideal spirit. Do yourself a favor and pour one of your better brandies into this one.\nAs you explore different brandies in the Japanese Cocktail, you might need to adjust the sweet or sour aspects slightly. Begin with the recommended pours of lime and orgeat and see what you think. One cognac may call for a little more orgeat while another may need a touch more lime. Take a mental note and make adjustments in the second round. Remember that everyone\'s taste is different as well and it\'s always a good idea to customize a drink to suit your personal taste. After all, you\'re the one drinking it, right?\nIt\'s not one of the most common ingredients in the bar, but orgeat (pronounced ""or-zat"") is rather useful. It\'s an almond-flavored syrup that is found in cocktails like the Mai Tai as well as other classic cocktail recipes.\nIf you cannot find orgeat and need a quick substitute, try amaretto or almond syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Japanese Cocktail?\nThe Japanese Cocktail, like many other cocktails of this sort, is a short drink of right around 3 1/2 ounces. If you consider that over half the drink is made up of a (typically) 80-proof liquor, you can understand the reasoning behind the shorter pour. On average, the Japanese Cocktail weighs in around 23 percent ABV (46 proof). This puts it right in line with most drinks served in a cocktail glass. It\'s a little weaker than the Martini but has a similar strength to juicier drinks like the Cosmopolitan.\nHomemade Orgeat Syrup']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/japanese-cocktail-recipe-759442

Beachbum Berry recommends Rhum Cl?ment VSOP Martinique Rum and Appleton Estate Extra Dark Jamaican Rum. If you cannot find those, there are many suitable alternatives in both styles, and light rum is a popular alternative to rhum agricole.\n\nRecipe Variations\nSymbolizing a palm tree, go with the traditional garnish of mint and a lime shell (half a lime partially hollowed out with a reamer) sunk into the crushed ice. A fun trick that should be executed with care while sober is to fill the lime shell with 151-proof rum and light it on fire before extinguishing and drinking.\nTry a fruitier Hawaiian-style mai tai: Shake 1 ounce of light rum, 1/2 ounce of triple sec, 1/4 ounce of lime juice, 1 1/2 ounces each of pineapple and orange juices, and a dash of grenadine with ice. Strain into an old-fashioned glass half-filled with ice, then float 1/2 ounce dark rum on top.\nFor a green-blue cocktail, use blue cura?ao as the orange liqueur in any mai tai recipe.\nWhat Does ""Mai Tai"" Mean?\nAccording to the story, Victor Bergeron mixed up a new drink at Trader Vic\'s for a friend visiting from Tahiti in 19443. It was inspired by the Q.C. Cooler, a blended drink by Donn ""Beachcomber"" Beach (the founder of the Polynesian-themed bar scene in the U.S.). In his mai tai, Bergeron used ""...17-year-old Jamaican J. Wray Nephew rum, added fresh lime, some orange cura?ao from Holland, a dash of rock candy syrup, and a dollop of French orgeat..."" and garnished it with lime and mint. The Tahitian exclaimed, ""Mai Tai?Roa Ae"" (""Out of this world?The best!""), giving Bergeron a name for his drink.2\nWhat Is Orgeat Syrup Made Of?\nOrgeat is a syrup made of almonds, sugar, water, and orange flower water that makes an appearance in many tropical cocktails. Almond syrup is a decent substitute, as is amaretto liqueur, though neither has the floral citrus taste that makes orgeat special.\nWhy Are There So Many Mai Tai Recipes?\nAfter its creation, it didn\'t take long for the mai tai to surpass the zombie cocktail as ""the"" drink to order at America\'s tiki bars. The owners and bartenders of these tropical-themed establishments were notorious for guarding recipes against competitors, so the recipes were tweaked often over the years. In 1953, Donn Beach remade the drink for a bar in Hawaii, adding pineapple and orange juices while keeping the mai tai name.3 Other tropical bars followed suit, creating original rum cocktails under the mai tai name to increase sales. Many pile layers of tropical fruit on top of rum and range in color from a brilliant red to bright blue. While these newer versions may be delicious, they are not the mai tai as it was originally intended.\nHow Strong Is a Mai Tai?\nMost mai tai recipes are rather potent drinks, mixing up to around 20 percent ABV (40 proof) when made with two 80 proof rums. The amount of alcohol will vary; some mai tais are stronger, while the fruitier recipes are slightly lighter.\nRethinking Tiki: How to Do Tropical Escapism Better']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/its-tiki-time-mai-tai-cocktail-759316

For a slightly less sweet colada, squeeze the juice of a lime wedge into the shaker.\nShake well for at least 30 seconds. When thoroughly shaken, the drink should be creamy with a luscious foam from the pineapple juice.\nStrain into a chilled collins glass. Alternatively, it will fill 1 large or 2 small cocktail glasses.\nGarnish with the pineapple wedge and maraschino cherry. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe pi?a colada is a very thick drink, even the shaken version. To lighten it up, fill the glass with crushed ice before straining the cocktail.\nIf you can't find cream of coconut, you can use coconut cream?just be sure to add sugar or simple syrup, to taste, to compensate for the lack of sweetness. However, try to avoid the coconut milk in cartons, as it tends to be a little too runny for shaken cocktails like this one.\nCanned pineapple juice is convenient. The small cans are 6 ounces and will make a few drinks. Unless you transfer it to another container, it can be difficult to keep large cans of pineapple juice fresh.\nIf you prefer, use fresh pineapple juice The average pineapple weighs 2 to 5 pounds, and yields about 6 ounces of juice per pound with an electric juicer. Without a juicer, crush 1 cup of pineapple chunks in the shaker using a muddler before shaking the drink. You can also blend fresh or frozen pineapple chunks and strain the resulting mixture through a fine-mesh strainer.\nWhat Is the Best Pi?a Colada Mix?\nWhile we don't have one single brand to recommend, the more expensive option is almost always better when buying cocktail mixes. Note that most pi?a colada mixes contain dairy, even though the original recipe does not, in case that's a concern. Regardless, because a pi?a colada has just three ingredients, it truly isn't worth your time or money to buy a mix. If you're understandably concerned about splurging on ingredients, you can save money by buying mini liquor bottles instead of a pricey handle of rum. While you might not get higher-shelf rums in this size, the added cost benefit can justify buying the cream of coconut and pineapple, which are likely to cost less than a mix anyway.\nWhat Is Cream of Coconut?\nCream of coconut is similar to condensed milk, except that it's made with coconut milk instead of cow's milk. It's thick, syrupy, and sweet, and typically comes in a can. Note that cream of coconut is different from coconut cream, which is the fatty, creamy part of canned coconut milk that you can skim off the top. Canned coconut milk can come sweetened or unsweetened and has a milder, butterier flavor than cream of coconut. Cream of coconut is the best choice in this recipe because of its thickness and richness; Coco Casa and Coco Lopez are two popular brands.\nRecipe Variations\nTry an aged or flavored rum (either commercial or a homemade infusion). Coconut rum is an obvious choice, but other fruits can work just as well.\nIf you prefer vodka, pour it instead of the rum. To add flavor, try either coconut or pineapple vodkas, or a combination of the two.\nBrandy is used in the frozen kappa colada, and it's a great alternative in the shaken drink.\nFor a virgin version of the pi?a colada, skip the rum and shake 4 ounces of pineapple juice with 2 ounces of cream of coconut.\nHow Strong Is the Pi?a Colada?\nThis pi?a colada recipe is pretty average. It's not the lightest drink, nor is it the strongest cocktail you can make. With an 80 proof rum, the alcohol content is a reasonable 13 percent ABV (26 proof). It's similar to a glass of wine, only far more delicious.\nThe Ultimate Cocktails Guide""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pina-colada-cocktail-recipe-759330

Like most classic cocktails, it is rather transparent, so each element that goes into it should be chosen carefully.\nPick up a good light rum, and use the same dry vermouth you'd pour into your martini. For the cura?ao, go with a top-shelf brand like Bols or Senior, and skip the super cheap bottles at the bottom of the liquor store shelf. You can also use other high-end orange liqueurs, such as a triple sec like Cointreau or the brandy-based Grand Marnier.\nThe grenadine may only be a dash, but should not be an afterthought that's casually tossed in. Search out a real grenadine that's made with pomegranate or make your own grenadine at home. It's such a vital ingredient in the bar that it's worth it, and you will notice the difference in every drink you mix it into.\nRecipe Variation\nThe classic El Presidente recipe is different than a far more modern creation that goes by the same name. At some point in the late 1900s, the recipe transformed to become a sweet-sour tropical cocktail that is good but may not be to everyone's liking: shake 2 ounces light rum, 1/2 ounce each lime juice and pineapple juice, and a dash of grenadine with ice. Strain it into a cocktail glass.\nHow Strong Is a El Presidente?\nWhen you see a drink that's made almost entirely of alcohol, you can expect it to be pretty strong. That's the case with El Presidente, which has an average alcohol content around 24 percent ABV (48 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/el-presidente-recipe-759652

For an extra-frothy drink, discard the ice and dry shake for a few more seconds.\nStrain into a chilled highball glass over fresh ice cubes.\nTop with soda and garnish with a lemon or lime peel. Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk of foodborne illness.\nTips\nThe gin fizz is an excellent mixed drink when exploring gin brands and will be slightly different with each one you pour. It doesn\'t have to be top-shelf or any particular style; genever is a classic choice.\nThe choice between lemon and lime juice is a personal one. Try lemon with sweeter gins or those with a lighter juniper profile. Lime is a good choice with drier, juniper-forward options like a classic London dry gin.\nIf you include the egg, do the ""sink or float test"" to ensure it\'s fresh. When placed in a glass of water, fresh eggs will sink to the bottom.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many variations on the gin fizz, and it\'s often as simple as changing a single ingredient.\nReplace the simple syrup with 1 to 2 teaspoons of superfine sugar and shake well.\nA fresh sour mix can replace the citrus juice and simple syrup. Pour about 1 ounce, then adjust to taste on the next round.\nThe royal fizz uses an entire egg rather than the white alone. This will give your drink a foamy top as well as a slightly eggier flavor.\nFor a golden fizz, switch from an egg white to an egg yolk. You\'ll lose the foam but have a drink with a little more egg flavor.\nTo make a diamond fizz, use sparkling wine instead of soda in the original gin fizz recipe.\nIf you add a dash of green cr?me de menthe to the gin fizz, you\'ll have a green fizz.\nSkip the soda and you have a gin sour.\nHow Strong Is a Gin Fizz?\nLike most tall mixed drinks, the gin fizz is a relatively light cocktail. When made with an 80-proof gin, its alcohol content should be in the 13 percent ABV (26 proof) range, making it the equivalent of drinking a glass of wine.\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Gin Fizz and a Tom Collins?\nThe gin fizz and the Tom Collins contain the same basic ingredients: gin, lemon juice, simple syrup or granulated sugar, and soda water. The gin fizz is shaken for a fizzy drink and sometimes includes an egg white for more froth.

Plymouth Gin revived a traditional recipe using real sloes; this brand is one of the best and most readily available sloe gins to be found today. \nMore distillers have caught on to the trend and brands like Hayman\'s, Bramley & Gage, Gordon\'s, and Sipsmith have very impressive sloe gins as well. You might want to steer clear of cheaper brands of sloe gin as many don\'t use natural ingredients.\nAs you experiment with different sloe gins, you also might find that some of these work better than others. You will find that some sloe gins note ""creamy topped"" on the label. When shaken, there will be a creamy head on top of these sloe gins. The effect is similar to the foam of an egg cocktail and that\'s why the sloe gin fizz doesn\'t necessarily require the egg found in the popular gin fizz.\nRecipe Variations\nHere are some excellent variations recommended by our experts:\nPour 1 ounce each of gin and sloe gin. This mix is best when you have a syrupy-sweet sloe gin.\nAdjust the simple syrup amount to fit your taste and the sloe gin you\'re using.\nUse a sour mix instead of lemon juice and simple syrup.\nSplit the soda, filling halfway with plain soda and the rest with lemon-lime soda.\nSkip the sweetener altogether, replacing it with maple syrup, or use 1 teaspoon superfine sugar rather than simple syrup.\nAdd an egg white for a foamy top. When doing so, dry shake the ingredients without ice, then fill the shaker with ice and shake for a full 30 seconds before straining.\nHow Strong Is the Sloe Gin Fizz?\nEven with all of the variables, the sloe gin fizz is a rather casual cocktail, which is why it was once a favorite morning drink. The strength will vary depending on how much soda you pour and if you include gin, though it\'s almost always in the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sloe-gin-fizz-cocktail-recipe-759812

With only two ingredients, this is not a cocktail where you want to be frugal.\nEvery gin is different. You may want to change the ratio and the garnish when switching from one brand to another.\nVermouth has a short shelf life because it\'s a fortified wine, not a distilled spirit. If your bottle has been open for longer than three months, it\'s time to replace it.\nIt\'s thought that the lemon twist is the original martini garnish. The olives may have become an option when vodka was introduced as a gin substitute.\nFor the olive garnish, skewer either one or three olives on a cocktail pick or simply drop them in the glass. It\'s an old bar tale that an even number of olives is bad luck.\nIf the olives are big or stuffed with jalape?os, garlic, or the like, one olive will usually do. The flavor of the olive will slowly infuse into the drink and add just a little more dimension as it rests.\nRecipe Variations\nIt\'s one drink, yet there are so many options. Among those are a few common recipes, and each has its own name:\nDry Martini: Traditionally, this used more dry vermouth, which seems like the most logical approach. However, today\'s dry martini is typically defined as using little or no vermouth; a ""wet"" martini uses more vermouth.\nBone Dry or Desert Martini: Used for times when you want to clarify that no vermouth makes it into the mix. Essentially, you\'re drinking chilled gin. It\'s said that Winston Churchill made his martinis by merely chilling gin and bowing in the direction of France, where dry vermouth originated.\n50-50 Martini: The ultimate ""wet"" martini, this recipe uses equal parts of gin and dry vermouth.\nPerfect Martini: Get a slightly sweeter profile by using equal parts of sweet and dry vermouth.\nVodka Martini: Replace the gin with vodka. This is popular among drinkers who don\'t necessarily enjoy the ""piney flavor"" of gin.\nGibson: Nothing changes from the original gin martini except the garnish. This cocktail makes use of those tiny cocktail onions.\nDirty Martini: Add a small amount of olive brine or juice to give the drink a salty-savory twist.\nHow to Make Martinis for a Crowd\nTo make a large batch of Martinis for a party, follow these steps:\nMake one Martini and measure its volume in ounces before and after stirring with ice and straining. The difference between the numbers is the amount of water that is incorporated into the drink.\nMultiply the gin, vermouth, and water by the number of servings you want to make.\nUse the resulting numbers to help you figure out how many bottles of each ingredient you\'ll need to buy. Remember that alcohol is usually sold in 750mL bottles. 750mL is approximately 25 1/4 ounces.\nOnce you have your ingredients, measure them out according to the math you did in Step 2.\nMix the ingredients together, place in a serving vessel, and chill well.\nTo serve each drink, measure out the amount of cocktail you recorded in step 1 after being stirred with ice and strained. Pour into a cocktail glass. Add the optional bitters if desired. Garnish and serve.\nHow Strong Is the Martini?\nThe martini is by no means a light drink. That\'s why it is served short and rarely poured over 3 or 4 ounces. With the standard 80-proof gin, the martini in this recipe\'s proportions weighs in around 31 percent ABV (62 proof). It is, without a doubt, one of the strongest drinks you can mix up.\n30 Best Martini Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-gin-martini-recipe-759739

This gives you the option to drink from the salted rim or the unsalted rim.

While they're the most familiar brands of their respective flavor in bars, they are premium liqueurs, and there are more economical alternatives for each. However, if you also want to use the liqueurs in fancier drinks, it's best to stick with these brands or something of equal quality.\nFor drinkers who enjoy a DIY project or two, both liqueurs are excellent candidates for homemade liqueurs.

Viable options include amaretto, pecan liqueurs, and nocino, an Italian walnut liqueur.\nMany other fruit liqueurs, including strawberry and apricot, will play well with any nut liqueur. The black currant flavor of cr?me de cassis would make a delicious shot as well. \nIf you enjoy the taste of this shot, give the nuts and berries cocktail a try. It uses the same liqueurs but adds cream to the mix for a tasty dessert drink.\nHow Strong Is the Peanut Butter and Jelly Shot?\nThis is a relatively mild shot and significantly less potent than a straight shot of tequila. When made with the most common liqueurs, the peanut butter and jelly shot's alcohol content is around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).\nIs Peanut Butter Whiskey Good in a PB&J Shot?\nA few brands produce peanut butter whiskey. It is most often a 35 percent ABV (70 proof) whiskey liqueur flavored to taste like peanut butter. Many drinkers fall for its sweet taste, and it is a good substitute for nutty liqueurs. Try the peanut butter and jelly shot with equal parts of peanut butter whiskey and raspberry liqueur, or make it with 2 parts whiskey and 1 part raspberry liqueur. You can also float the whiskey on top of the liqueur.\nBirthday Cake Shot""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/peanut-butter-and-jelly-shot-759765

No matter the glass, pour equal amounts of Champagne and stout.\nSince there is no ice involved in mixing this drink, it really is best when both ingredients are well-chilled. It's something you likely do for both sparkling wine and stout anyway but don't forget to do it when making the black velvet.\nThough traditionally made with French Champagne, any sparkling wine will create a nice black velvet. You might, for instance, pour Italy's Prosecco or Spain's cava, both of which tend to be less expensive than Champagne.\nRecipe Variation\nSome people prefer the black velvet with more Champagne rather than the 1:1 mix in this recipe. Try a 2:1 pour by visually dividing the glass into three parts, pouring that much wine, then topping it with the stout.\nHow Strong Is a Black Velvet?\nMixing two light alcoholic beverages is going to result in a light cocktail compared to most which typically include at least one liquor. Guinness Extra Stout is bottle at 5.6 percent alcohol by volume (ABV) and the average for Champagne is 12 percent ABV. Combining the two, the black velvet will be 8 percent ABV.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/black-velvet-recipe-759594

Serve and enjoy.\nWhere Can I Find Banana Liqueur?\nCr?me de banane, as it's known in France, where many of the best banana liqueurs are produced, offers a range of flavors depending on the brand, from sweet and overripe to roasted and fresher in taste. Most liqueurs are of a yellow hue, but some others come in green. If you can get your hands on a green banana liqueur, go for it, as your shot will be very brightly colored. Irish cream and blue cura?ao are very common liqueurs and regularly stocked in bars, but banana liqueur is a little more obscure. Most liquor stores should have at least one option. One of the most popular brands is 99 Bananas, but you'll find this liqueur from other well-known producers like Bols, Hiram Walker, and Dekuyper.\nNo Shaker? No Problem!\nIf you're mixing many of these shots and don't have a cocktail shaker, simply stir the liqueurs with ice in a tall glass and strain it into a shot glass. You could also just pour them straight into the glass, but to get the real Bazooka Joe taste, they need to be mixed.\nSubstitutions\nAlthough there aren't many good substitutes for these three liqueurs, here are some expert suggestions for the Bazzoka shot:\nRumChata would be a nice alternative to Irish cream and will not alter the shot's flavor too much.\nIf you can't find banana liqueur, skip it and use another fruity liqueur instead. Strawberry, raspberry, and grape would all be fun alternatives to customize your bubblegum experience.\nAny other orange-flavored liqueur (e.g., triple sec, Grand Marnier) will make a good substitute if you don't have blue cura?ao. The shot will still be delicious but you will lose the fun blue color.\nHow Strong Is a Bazooka Joe?\nThe banana liqueur you choose to use in the Bazooka Joe is going to play a big part in the shot's alcohol content. While the other two liqueurs are nearly the same proof regardless of the brand, banana's a different story. Most banana liqueurs, including Bols, weigh in around 17 percent ABV (34 proof). However, 99 Bananas is a whopping 99 proof (49.5 percent ABV). That means your Bazooka Joe made with Bols will be about 11 percent ABV (22 proof), and one with 99 Bananas will shake up to 19 percent ABV (38 proof).

Add a little this or that, and you have a whimsical, new drink to enjoy:\nAdd a touch of sparkle: There are times when the woo woo can be too sweet, so a little sparkle will quickly liven it up and make it more refreshing. Top it with seltzer, club soda, or ginger ale, or fancy it up a bit with sparkling wine. This is a fabulous idea when making it as a punch because it dilutes the drink so that your guests won't get drunk off of two glasses.\nUse flavored vodka: Whether you make your own or buy it at the liquor store, the woo woo is a perfect candidate for almost any flavored vodka you want to throw into it: strawberry, vanilla, cucumber, or watermelon are all great choices. Try adding fruit liqueurs, syrups, or fruit juices.\nAdd fruits: Toss in fruit to beautify the woo woo. From berries to watermelon, it's hard to go wrong when adding fruit to this drink. For whole or cut fruit, muddle it in the shaker before adding the other ingredients.\nAdd citrus: Although the cranberry juice provides some acidity, adding a little bit of fresh lemon or lime juice (1/4 to 1/2 ounce) will brighten the whole drink.\nWoo Woo Punch or Party Shot\nWoo Woo Party Punch: Increase the ingredients proportionally to fill a pitcher or punch bowl. For instance, use full 750-milliliter bottles of vodka and peach schnapps with about 50 ounces of cranberry juice. This will produce about 25 4-ounce drinks that can be served with or without ice.\nWoo Woo Party Shot: When transforming this drink into a shooter, the cranberry juice is typically cut in half, so there's more alcohol content. Pour equal parts?about 1/2 ounce each?of the three ingredients. Shake it to ensure a good mix.\nHow Strong Is the Woo Woo Cocktail?\nThe woo woo is a relatively mild cocktail, not much stronger than the average glass of wine. That's what makes it so appealing?but also what makes it easy to have one too many. When made with Peachtree at 48 proof and an 80 proof vodka, this woo woo recipe has an alcohol content of about 14 percent ABV (28 proof). But if you cut the cranberry juice to make a 2-ounce shooter, that content more than doubles to a whopping 32 percent ABV (64 proof).\n16 Delicious Cranberry Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/woo-woo-cocktail-recipe-759852

Avoid whipping it so long that it becomes whipped cream, but it should thicken and increase in volume slightly.\nPlace the bowl in the freezer for 15 minutes to give it a good chill. If not making butterbeer immediately, cover the bowl and store in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.\nMake the Butterbeer\nFill a frosty glass about two-thirds full with cold vanilla cream soda.\nPour the chilled butterbeer batter over the back of a spoon and into the glass. It will naturally rise to the top and float on the soda. Make this layer as thick as you like, but go slow because it will grow fast.\nServe it with a straw or drink it straight from the glass (and experience the foamy mustache). Enjoy.\nTips\nThough it is best fresh, the batter can be refrigerated for up to 2 days in a well-sealed container.\nYou want a frosty mug or tall glass for cold butterbeer. For a quick chill, rinse each glass with cold water and place them in the coldest part of your freezer for at least 2 hours.\nMake Hot Butterbeer\nTo make hot butterbeer, prepare the batter, then slowly heat up the batter and soda separately. Do this very gently so the cream doesn\'t curdle and the soda doesn\'t lose all of its carbonation.\nYou can also warm the soda and leave the batter chilled for a more accurate reflection of the book\'s drink. For a party, keep the soda warm in a slow cooker on the warm setting and add the batter to the glasses.\nOn the stovetop, warm both ingredients over low heat and stir the batter almost continuously. You do not want either ingredient to come to a boil, they just need to be warmed.\nIn the microwave, warm them in small increments. It should take less than 2 minutes for each ingredient.\nJust as a frosty glass improves the cold butterbeer experience, a warm glass creates a better warm butterbeer. Use a heat-proof glass such as an Irish coffee glass or coffee mug. While you\'re warming the ingredients, fill the glass with very hot water. Discard the water before pouring the drink using the same method as the cold butterbeer.\nMake Alcoholic Butterbeer\nSpiking butterbeer adds to the warming effect described in ""Harry Potter."" If only adults will be drinking, you can substitute 2 ounces of butterscotch schnapps for the sauce and mix it right into the batter. Alternatively, add liquor directly into the glass along with the soda. A shot of rum is a favorite, though sweet whipped cream vodka is another good choice.\nAn even better option takes a hint from an old Irish drink that may have inspired Rowling\'s butterbeer in the first place. This beverage combined melted butter with beer, and Irish whiskey sometimes made it into the mix. The whiskey is an excellent addition to this butterbeer recipe because it contrasts the drink\'s sweetness and gives it a good, hearty background.\nWhat Happens If the Cream Is Poured First?\nFor a proper butterbeer, it\'s critical that you pour the ingredients in order: soda then batter. If you pour the batter first, when the soda hits the cream, it will instantly foam up, fill the glass, and leave you with very little soda. It won\'t settle like the foam on beer or soda, either. Instead, you\'ll be left with something a root beer float with just a touch of soda underneath. All is not lost if you pour it out of order because the creamy, carbonated foam is delicious.

The difference between the numbers is the amount of water that is incorporated into the drink.\nMultiply each ingredient, including the water, by the number of servings you want to make.\nFor the bitters, divide the number you got in Step Two by 2. Bitters tend to become more pronounced over time in batched cocktails so you don't need to use as much. Alternatively, since the recipe calls for 1 to 2 dashes of each type of bitters, you can just assume 1 dash in your initial calculations.\nUse the resulting numbers to help you figure out how many bottles of alcohol you'll need to buy. Remember that alcohol is usually sold in 750mL bottles. 750mL is approximately 25 1/4 ounces.\nOnce you have your ingredients, measure them out according to the math you did in Steps 2 and 3 (including the water).\nMix the ingredients together, place in a serving vessel, and chill well.\nTo serve, measure out the amount of cocktail you recorded in step 1 after being stirred with ice and strained. Pour it into a glass filled with ice and garnish as directed.\nRead more about how to batch cocktails here.\nChoosing a Rye Whiskey\nThough the rye whiskey and cognac are equal pours in the Vieux Carr?, the rye takes center stage. Its naturally spicy flavor profile brings it to the forefront of this drink and that's why it's important to choose a great rye. The market for rye whiskey continues to expand and this recipe is a perfect place to explore any new bottle you come across. Many of the best rye whiskeys are coming from small craft brewers so look around for bottles that may not get national attention. There are some hidden gems out there.\nHow Strong Is the Vieux Carr??\nMost rye whiskey is bottled above the standard 80-proof. This higher strength allows those spicy rye notes to really stand out and adds to the depth of the whiskey. It also makes rye a perfect option for any whiskey cocktail. With that noted, the Vieux Carr?'s estimated alcohol content using a full-flavored, 100-proof rye whiskey along with a mild 80-proof cognac is about 29 percent ABV (58 proof), one of the strongest cocktails you can mix up. While it is potent, it's also full of flavor and that is why the original recipe makes just under a 3-ounce drink.

Pomegranates are in season throughout the winter. When the price is right, fresh juice can be much cheaper than bottled juices. While those bottled juices are convenient, this is one fruit juice that is notoriously expensive.\nRecipe Variations\nTo give this an alcoholic spin, you can always add rum to the mix. We recommend using equal amounts (1 1/2 ounces each) of white rum, pomegranate juice, and lemonade.\nMake this a pitcher cocktail by multiplying the ingredients by the number of servings, muddling in a pitcher, and assembling per the recipe.

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nIt's easy to make this drink taller or by the pitcher: Just add more soda to taste. For a large batch, keep the vodka and Chambord at equal pours, then add about four or five times that amount of soda. Add ice to individual glasses, and pour the mix over the top.\nRecipe Variations\nChoose a flavored vodka over a clear one. Pour complementary flavors for the raspberry such as citrus, peach, vanilla, or any of your favorite berry vodkas.\nGive the zipper a little pizazz when fresh berries are in season by muddling a few in the bottom of the glass before pouring the liquors. Raspberries are a natural fit because Chambord is a black raspberry liqueur, but other berries will work as well.\nA mint garnish and a squeeze of fresh lime juice add a subtle spark to the cocktail. If you're muddling berries, go ahead and add some mint at that time to get even more of the herb's essence.\nSwitch to sparkling wine as a substitute for the soda. If the wine is a brut, the drink will be slightly dry, which is offset by the sweet Chambord. Even a sec or demi-sec wine will not be as sweet as the soda, and all are very nice options.\nHow Strong Is the Zipper?\nThe zipper is a relatively gentle drink and its strength can be adjusted by the amount of soda you pour. When made with 80-proof vodka and 1 ounce of soda, the alcohol content is around 16 percent ABV (32 proof). If you pour 5 ounces of soda to fill a tall glass, you'll knock it down to a mild 7 percent ABV (14 proof).\nWhy Is Chambord So Expensive?\nChambord takes time and effort to make, which accounts for its cost. It is rich, lush, and sweet, made with raspberries and blackberries in cognac and French spirits base?and imported from France. The process of making Chambord isn't easy; it is a finely crafted blend of infused spirits and cognac. Although it's not the least expensive liqueur, it is delicious. You can use cr?me de cassis instead, but it's not quite the same. However, if you splurge on a bottle and stock your bar with Chambord, it won't go to waste. You'll likely use it again and again, and it will keep for a while as long as it's stored in a cool, dark place.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/zipper-cocktail-recipe-759867

If you're using one of those, you might want to back off a bit on the schnapps.\nIf you want to skip the ice (and the potential dilution that comes with it), pour this drink into a frosty glass.\nYou can also chill your bottle of schnapps before pouring it. Simply place it in the freezer for an hour or so. There's no need to worry about the liquor freezing, especially if it's a higher-proof schnapps.\nRecipe Variations\nQuite often, people like to make a big batch of this drink to take along on outdoor winter adventures. To do so, simply combine as much of the two liquors as you like?keeping the ratio at 3:1?and pour it into a flask or thermos.\nAnother popular variation is to serve this drink warm by heating up the mix on the stovetop. Use a small saucepan and make a larger batch to pour into a thermos. Keep the heat low and don't let it come to a boil. Also, remember that alcohol is flammable, so be careful not to spill, particularly if you have a gas stove.\nOther mint liqueurs, such as cr?me de menthe, can be used instead of peppermint schnapps.\nHow Strong Is a Snowshoe Grog?\nThe snowshoe grog is a tough drink that packs a punch in both flavor and alcohol. When made with 30 proof schnapps, it mixes up to 27 percent ABV (54 proof). Jump that up to 44 percent ABV (88 proof) with a 100 proof schnapps. It will be even stronger if you skip the ice and opt for a straight pour.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/snowshoe-grog-recipe-761499

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPour as little or as much grenadine as you like. Some drinkers prefer the hint of sweetness from adding just a splash. If you like your drinks sweet, however, you might want to pour as much as 3/4 ounce.\nConsider making your own grenadine. It's easy to do, either from pomegranate juice or the fresh fruit. It will offer the freshest taste and is useful in many mixed drink recipes.\nYou will also find that the jack rose is best with fresh-squeezed lemon juice. The average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces of juice, which is more than enough for a few drinks.\nMaximize the use of a single lemon by cutting the lemon twist while it's still whole and before juicing the fruit.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you can't find applejack, a regular apple brandy will do just fine. Do read the labels carefully because some of these flavored brandies are sweetened into liqueurs, in which case you'll want to back off a bit on the grenadine.\nYou can adjust the flavor slightly without disturbing the jack rose's lovely color by substituting cherry brandy, cr?me de noyaux, raspberry liqueur, or any other red liqueur for the grenadine.\nHow Strong Is a Jack Rose?\nSince applejack is typically a full-strength liquor, the jack rose is not going to be a light cocktail. When made with 80 proof applejack, it should have an alcohol content in the 24 percent ABV (48 proof) range. That will vary with any customizations you make and is just slightly weaker than the brandy metropolitan.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jack-rose-cocktail-recipe-759708

It will sink and gradually rise to mix with the other ingredients.\nGarnish with an orange slice and cherry. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf the tequila sunrise is a tad too sweet for your taste, try it with a dash of lime or lemon juice. This can balance out the taste without compromising the appearance and central flavor of the drink.\nThe best tequila for a tequila sunrise is whatever you have in stock. There\'s no need to go top-shelf, but you also want to pour a tequila that you actually enjoy. The fruit flavors are heavy, so it\'s OK to be frugal with this drink.\nTo make the tequila sunrise by the pitcher, simply increase the ingredients. Retain the 1 part tequila to 2 parts orange juice or use 3 parts juice to soften the alcohol. Add the grenadine either in the pitcher or pour it into each glass. Likewise, use ice in the pitcher or glasses, or both.\nTequila Sunrise History\nThere are a few stories behind the origin of the tequila sunrise. As with most cocktail histories, things get a little cloudy at times, and it\'s hard to know which story to believe.\nOne account claims that the drink welcomed tourists to Cancun and Acapulco in the 1950s. A more plausible story points to Gene Sulit, who tended bar at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in the 1930s and \'40s. He likely created the original version. Another credits it to bartenders Bobby Lazoff and Billy Rice at The Trident, a restaurant in Sausalito, California, during the tequila craze of the 1970s. It\'s thought that this is where the drink transformed into the popular orange juice version.\nThe Original Tequila Sunrise Recipe\nThe original tequila sunrise is sparkling, light, and features cr?me de cassis, a sweet black currant liqueur with a deep red color. To make this drink, pour 1 1/2 ounces of tequila and the juice of half a lime into a collins glass filled with ice. Top with club soda, then slowly pour 3/4 ounce cr?me de cassis into the drink. Garnish with a lime wheel and maraschino cherry.\nHow Strong Is a Tequila Sunrise?\nAssuming that you pour an 80-proof tequila and end up with a 7-ounce drink, the alcohol content of either tequila sunrise will be around 11 percent ABV (22 proof). You can pour as much tequila or as little juice and soda as you like to make stronger or weaker drinks, but it\'s almost always a relatively mild cocktail.\nRecipe Variations\nThe signature sunrise effect of the tequila sunrise has inspired many drinks over the years. If you enjoy that touch of sweetness and the beautiful impression it leaves in your glass, give one of these recipes a try:\nWhen you don\'t feel like drinking (or if it\'s too early in the morning), skip the tequila, and enjoy a virgin sunrise. It\'s a tasty way to sweeten up your OJ.\nThere is a margarita for everything, and the blended tequila sunrise margarita is quite fun.\nThe firefly pairs vodka and grapefruit juice with grenadine to create a simple, tart drink.\nSimilarly, the ruby rum sunrise is a sweet-sour rum cocktail with grapefruit juice.\nA stunning martini-style drink, the sour sunrise switches to bourbon whiskey. This can be made with just tequila and orange juice as well. For these ""up"" versions that are not served over ice, shaking the liquor and juice, then straining it into the glass lightens up the drink.\nThe peach candy corn cocktail is a playful whipped cream vodka cocktail that\'s ideal for Halloween.\nFor a delicate mocktail featuring peach juice, try the sparkling peach sunrise.\nThe Waterloo sunset mixes gin, elderflower, and Champagne with a raspberry-flavored sunrise.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between a Tequila Sunrise and a Tequila Sunset?\nQuite often, tequila sunset is just another name for a tequila sunrise. Then again, it can be an entirely different recipe. Some use grapefruit juice instead of orange, while others use a blend of pineapple and orange. In all of those, though, the grenadine is at the bottom, just like in a sunrise.\n\nFor the opposite effect that places a red layer at the top of the drink (like a true sunset), you\'ll need to use a lighter ingredient than straight grenadine. One option is to mix a little soda with grenadine before adding it to the tequila mix. Blackberry brandy is commonly used as a substitute for grenadine in a tequila sunset, and most brands should be light enough to float on top. Other red liquors may work as well, depending on their specific gravity. You could even use dark rum; mix it with food coloring if you really want the red layer. With all of these tequila sunset options, pour the top layer over the back of a barspoon so it floats.\nRanch Water Recipe']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tequila-sunrise-recipe-760754

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nThe Manhattan has inspired countless cocktails over the years. You may also notice that many share only the whiskey in common with the original recipe. Just as the name ""martini"" is popular with fancy vodka and gin cocktails and ""margarita"" is a common choice for tequila cocktails, ""Manhattan"" has become synonymous with nearly any whiskey cocktail that\'s served ""up.""\nDry Manhattan: Use a dash of dry vermouth and garnish with a lemon twist.\nPerfect Manhattan: Use equal parts sweet and dry vermouth and garnish with a lemon twist.\nRob Roy (aka Scotch Manhattan): This variation specifically calls for Scotch whisky.\nMetropolitan (aka Brandy Manhattan): This cocktail replaces the whiskey with brandy.\nSouthern Comfort Manhattan: Use Southern Comfort instead of whiskey to get a hint of peach.\nHow to Make Manhattans for a Crowd\nTo make a large batch of Manhattans for a party, follow these steps:\nMake one Manhattan and measure its volume in ounces before and after stirring with ice and straining. The difference between the numbers is the amount of water that is incorporated into the drink.\nMultiply each ingredient, including the water, by the number of servings you want to make.\nFor the bitters, divide the number you got in Step Two by 2. Bitters tend to become more pronounced over time in batched cocktails so you don\'t need to use as much.\nUse the resulting numbers to help you figure out how many bottles of each ingredient you\'ll need to buy. Remember that drinks are usually sold in 750mL bottles. 750mL is approximately 25 1/4 ounces.\nOnce you have your ingredients, measure them out according to the math you did in Steps 2 and 3.\nMix the ingredients together, place in a serving vessel, and chill well.\nTo serve, measure out the amount of cocktail you recorded in step 1 after being stirred with ice and strained. Garnish and serve.\nRead more about how to batch cocktails here.\nHow Strong Is a Manhattan?\nThe Manhattan is not a light cocktail. It is a very liquor-forward cocktail because it includes alcohol alone and is diluted with just a small amount of water during preparation. Assuming that an 80 proof whiskey is used, the average Manhattan is around 30 percent ABV (60 proof). This is just slightly weaker than a straight shot of that same whiskey, so take it easy with this one.\nHow Do You Order a Manhattan Drink?\nWhen ordering a Manhattan at the bar, you may want to ""call"" your whiskey of choice. Most bars will have a house whiskey that they regularly use in the cocktail and it could be a rye, bourbon, or Canadian. You can always ask what they use and upgrade if you prefer something else. Be as specific as you like. For instance, you could either ask for a specific brand-Manhattan or a ""bourbon Manhattan"" (in this case you will get the house bourbon).\nWhat Is the Difference Between a Manhattan and an Old-Fashioned?\nBoth classic whiskey cocktails, there are essential differences between a Manhattan and an old-fashioned. A Manhattan is a combination of whiskey and sweet vermouth with a few dashes of bitters. An old-fashioned is a mixture of bourbon or whiskey, sugar, and bitters (no vermouth).\nClassic Cocktails Every Drinker Should Try']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/classic-manhattan-cocktail-759321

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nShaking the brandy cocktail is very common as it gives the drink extra dilution that marries the flavors rather nicely. As a liquor-only cocktail, you might prefer to stir rather than shake. Try it both ways to see which method you enjoy most.\nIf you pour a quality brandy, make sure your choice in orange cura?ao follows suit. This is not a place to save money, because many of the least expensive brands are too sweet and will bring down the taste of this fine cocktail.\nEnsure you pick up ""orange"" cura?ao (which is actually clear) instead of the very popular blue option or the rare green.\nTriple sec and brandy-based orange liqueurs (such as Grand Marnier) can be a substitute for cura?ao. However, the same recommendation applies to the quality of the liqueur you pour. A better cocktail is made of quality ingredients all the way around, and it\'s even more important in a drink that\'s this simple.\nRecipe Variations\nIn the early days of cocktails, you would order a basic ""\'cocktail"" by calling the base spirit, and it would be made similar to this. For instance, drinkers would have ordered a gin cocktail or a whiskey cocktail, or almost any liquor of choice.\nAngostura is a staple in most bars, but Peychaud\'s is not. It is worth picking up a bottle because it\'s essential as the bitters for famous classic drinks such as the Sazerac. However, if you don\'t have it, try another type. There\'s no true substitute, but this drink would be excellent with orange bitters or old-fashioned replicas like The Bitter Truth\'s Creole Bitters or Jerry Thomas\' Own Decanter Bitters.\nHow Do You Properly Drink Brandy?\nIf for some reason you\'d like to try this beverage neat, here are some good guidelines.\nDrink brandy at room temperature in a snifter.\nDon\'t dilute it with water or ice; it destroys the flavor.\nSniff the brandy, put your hands around the glass to warm it gently, and take small sips.\nHow Strong Is a Brandy Cocktail?\nMany of the best old-fashioned drinks are not weak drinks. In fact, they tend to be higher in alcohol than many modern cocktail recipes because they rarely use nonalcoholic mixers. The brandy cocktail is no exception, and it averages out to around 30 percent ABV (60 proof). That\'s right in line with the martini and Manhattan and slightly under the bottling proof of the average brandy.

Preheat the oven to 400 F.\nOn a rimmed baking sheet, spread the almonds out in a single layer. Toast in the oven for 4 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for about 5 minutes.\nIn a food processor or chopper, chop the almonds to a coarse grind (not the sand-like texture of almond flour).\nTransfer the ground almonds to a large bowl and cover them with warm water. Let soak for 1 to 3 hours, depending on how strong you would like the almond flavor.\nUsing a fine-mesh strainer and two large layers of cheesecloth, squeeze all of the liquid from the almonds into a deep bowl. The almond pulp should be almost completely dry and you'll have about 1 cup of liquid.\nIn a small saucepan over medium-low heat, gently warm the almond liquid.\nWhisk in the sugar and continue stirring until the sugar is completely dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat.\nStrain the orgeat syrup through two layers of clean cheesecloth. Stir in the orange flower water and, if using, the brandy or vodka and citric acid.\nOnce the syrup has cooled completely, transfer it to a bottle with a tight-sealing lid.\nRefrigerate the orgeat syrup and shake before using it in your favorite drinks. Enjoy.\nHow to Store\nOrgeat should be kept refrigerated. With the liquor and citric acid, the homemade orgeat syrup will keep well for up to 2 months. Without those preservatives, use the syrup within 1 week.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than roasted almonds, use blanched almonds. Soak them in enough water to cover for 30 minutes and drain off the water before grinding. When blanching raw almonds yourself, you can remove the skins for a white-colored, less bitter syrup or leave them on for a slightly bitter golden syrup.\nSwitch to raw granulated sugar for a richer flavor and slightly darker color. Coconut (or palm) sugar would be an interesting substitution, too.\nRose water is a common alternative to orange flower water.\nUse this recipe to make pistachio orgeat syrup from raw pistachios. Roasted hazelnuts are another great nut for homemade syrups.\nCan Orgeat Syrup Be Made From Prepared Almond Milk?\nThe first few steps of this recipe create a liquid similar to fresh almond milk but the nuts are not blended back into the liquid. While it is best from almonds, unsweetened homemade or store-bought almond milk can be used to make orgeat syrup. Use 1 cup of prepared almond milk and jump ahead to heating the milk.\nIs Almond Syrup the Same As Orgeat?\nAlmond syrup is a sweetened, almond-flavored simple syrup often used in coffee drinks. Orgeat is a cocktail mixer and, in addition to almonds, it is flavored with orange flower water. In a pinch, almond syrup can be used in cocktails that call for orgeat, but note that it will not have the exact same flavor and may be sweeter, so add in moderation.\nWhat Is the Alcohol Content of Orgeat Syrup?\nIf you choose to skip the liquor in this recipe, then your orgeat syrup is alcohol-free. Even with 1 ounce of 40-proof brandy or vodka, this orgeat syrup's alcohol content is negligible at around 3 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). Some cough medicines contain three times that amount and, as a mixer, this will have little effect on the drinks you make with it.\nRum Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/orgeat-syrup-recipe-5095919

Equal parts are recommended, but you may enjoy less vermouth; some drinkers even pour as little as 1/2 ounce.\nBe sure to choose a quality rum for this drink. It\'s a very transparent mix and will show off any imperfections in the rum. If you enjoy sipping the rum straight, it\'s a good choice.\nIf it\'s been a while since you opened that bottle of sweet vermouth, consider replacing it. It has a shelf-life of just two to three months once open and should be stored in the refrigerator.\nWhen cutting the lemon twist, you might find it easiest to use a canelle knife. The average pairing knife works with some practice.\nRoll the twist gently into a spiral and give it squeeze over the drink to express the fruit\'s oils. This will give the cocktail a bright, subtle accent.\nRecipe Variations\nThe original Jean Harlow cocktail recommends light rum, though you can use a nice aged rum instead. You\'ll find that the hint of oak is a pleasant addition to the drink.\nAdd a nice accent to this cocktail with a few dashes of bitters. Aromatic bitters (e.g., Angostura) would be excellent. You can play around with other flavors, such as barrel-aged bitters, orange bitters, or peach bitters.\nRum is made from sugar or molasses, so it has a naturally sweeter profile. That\'s why it\'s paired with sweet vermouth in this cocktail. If, however, you want to use dry vermouth, you\'ll likely want to add a sweetener. For example, the El Presidente recipe brings a little cura?ao and grenadine into the rum-dry vermouth mix.\nHow Strong Is a Jean Harlow Cocktail?\nAs with most alcohol-only cocktails, the Jean Harlow is a potent drink. When made with an 80-proof rum, it will shake up to about 24 percent ABV (48 proof).

If we were to pour an entire bottle of rum into the punch bowl, we would have some very intoxicated guests. So, like sangria, the wine dominates this classic punch.\nIt's a very easy punch to mix up and is better if you prepare it the night before. This gives the flavors a little extra time to meld and mesh to create a well-balanced drink.\nTo make the punch, combine 1 bottle red wine, 3 ounces rum, the juice of 1/2 lemon, and 4 barspoons superfine sugar in a punch bowl or pitcher. Stir well to make sure everything combines and the sugar dissolves. When it's time to serve, add ice and any variety of seasonal fruits you wish.\nThis punch will make about nine 4-ounce servings.\nThe Modern (Hold the Rum) Bishop Cocktail\nIf you are interested in the wine-only version of the bishop cocktail, it could not be easier. All you really need to do is replace the rum in the recipe with wine. Many bishop fans prefer a red wine from Burgundy, though any red you have in stock will do.\nMany bishop recipes call for a mix of lemon and orange juices rather than lime. Simply split the juice in the recipe between the two. \nThe last difference is that many modern bishop cocktails are served on the rocks in a highball glass. In reality, you can serve a bishop with or without ice, depending on your mood.\nHow to Choose Red Wine for Mixing?\nSelect a red wine that you enjoy drinking by itself. Anything you like to drink can work to mix for this cocktail, but no need to use an expensive one.\nHow Strong Are the Bishop Cocktails?\nThese three bishop cocktails may look similar, but their alcohol content paints a very different picture. It's amazing what a little rum can do to the strength of a drink, as we can see when we run the numbers on the recipes.\n\nThe classic bishop: 27 percent ABV (54 proof)\nThe bishop punch: 11 percent ABV (22 proof)\nThe modern bishop cocktail: 9 percent ABV (18 proof)\n\nTo put these adaptations into perspective, imagine for a minute if we did not switch the rum and wine in the punch recipe. With a full bottle of rum, it would be a hefty 31 perfect ABV (62 proof). That's fine for your nightly martini, but when you're serving a crowd, it's simply too strong.\n25 Best Wine Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bishop-cocktail-recipe-760497

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPouring soda and cream together can create a lot of fizz, and it can get out of hand fast. The drink may also curdle when the soda hits the dairy cream. This varies with the soda brand because some contain more citric acid than others. To avoid both of these issues, always pour the cola very slowly.\nThe vodka doesn't have to be the best because there's so much going on in this drink. Save a little money by pouring whichever vodka you enjoy most and have in stock.\nRecipe Variations\nBartenders often shake the vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream with ice, then strain the drink into an ice-filled glass and top it with soda.\nSimilarly, stir the drink after adding the cream, then slowly pour the soda on top for a semi-layered drink.\nPlay with the ratio of ingredients as you see fit. Some Colorado bulldog fans prefer a full 1 1/2-ounce shot of vodka with 3/4 ounce each of the coffee liqueur and cream. Pour just a splash of soda or up to 2 ounces to suit your taste.\nWhen the drink is made in a tall Collins glass, it's sometimes simply called a bulldog.\nPour a flavored vodka if you like. Good options include vanilla, caramel, and cherry.\nSwitch from vodka to tequila and you'll have a Colorado mother.\nFor a nonalcoholic Colorado bulldog, pour a shot of cold espresso over ice, add cream, and top with cola. It's a great afternoon pick-me-up.\nHow Strong Is the Colorado Bulldog?\nYou can make the Colorado bulldog as strong or as weak as you like. It all depends on how much cola you pour. In general, it's a gentle drink and a casual option for happy hour. When made with 2 ounces of cola, its alcohol content falls around 10 percent ABV (20 proof), or similar to the average glass of wine.\n22 Popular Vodka Cocktails to Check Off Your List""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/colorado-bulldog-cocktail-761032

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nSqueeze the juice from the lime wedge into the drink and drop it into the glass before drinking.\nIf you want to spritz up the Cape Cod, simply add a splash of your favorite clear soda. Ginger ale is a perfect choice.\nRecipe Variations\nCosmopolitan - Without a doubt, the Cosmo is the most popular vodka-cranberry martini around. It's a simple way to enjoy the duo in a fancier form and you can sweeten it as much as you like with the juice. All you need to add to the mix is an orange liqueur and a touch of lime.\nCrantini - This 'up' drink combines the easy of the Cape Cod with the style of the Cosmopolitan. It returns to that simple two-ingredient recipe we love in the highball, though it shakes things up and is served in a cocktail glass.\nJolly Rancher - A very fun rendition of the Cape Cod, here we return to the refreshing spiked juice combo on the rocks. This time, however, you'll choose your favorite apple vodka and toss in a little peach schnapps to make it taste like the famous candy.\nWoo Woo - If you love that peach-cranberry combination in the Jolly Rancher, you'll love the Woo Woo. It traditionally returns to a clear vodka, but use the flavor of your choice. You can also serve this fun cocktail 'up' in a cocktail glass, on the rocks, or as a party shot.\nPurple Haze - A fun and simple twist on the Cape Cod, you simply need to add a splash of black raspberry liqueur to the mix to create the cranberry version of the Purple Haze. Chambord's the most likely liqueur, but there are other options available as well.\nHow Strong Is the Cape Cod?\nAs with any highball mixed drink, you can make the Cape Cod as strong or weak as you like. It's as simple as pouring more or less of either of the two ingredients. If, however, you pour the drink according to the recipe above and use an 80-proof vodka, your Cape Cod will be right around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That's a little stronger than the average glass of wine.\nMore Vodka and Juice Drinks\nMixed drinks like the Cape Cod fall into two classifications: duos and trios. These terms are used to define simple liquor and juice drinks that are served either tall or short over ice. 'Duos' refer to two ingredients: liquor and one fruit juice. 'Trios' includes three ingredients: liquor and two fruit juices.\nAmong the duos and trios of the bartending world, vodka makes the biggest splash. It is, after all, the most mixable liquor in the bar, and with all this juice, it can easily get lost in the mix. This adds to its appeal for many drinkers.\nIf you add just one more juice to the Cape Cod, a number of equally popular mixed drinks are born. Knowing there is a fantastic way to spice up your routine with no extra effort, these drinks are worth filing into your memory bank.\nSea Breeze - The 'sea' comes from the addition of grapefruit juice. Think tropical breezes on the beach when remembering this one.\nBay Breeze - In the 'bay' we're thinking about pineapple juice. Place this one in your memory by recalling a calm cove on a tropical island.\nMadras - Orange juice makes the splash in this popular drink. To remember it, simply think of the mandarin orange.\nBartending 101: Essential Techniques, Tips, and Tricks""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cape-codder-recipe-759287

When it's too thin for your taste, add ice or ice cream.\nCanned pineapple is a good option if you don't have the fresh fruit around. Be sure to drain the juice, but you might want to keep it in reserve in case the drink needs to be thinned.\nWith blended cocktails, you'll find it best to use crushed ice to get a smooth consistency. If you only have ice cubes, add those to the blender on their own and chop them up before adding the rest of the ingredients.\nRecipe Variations\nTry the chi-chi with a coconut vodka instead. It adds a brightness that really ramps up that flavor in the drink. For a budget-friendly option, look for New Amsterdam Coconut. Ciroc Coconut Vodka is one of the best available in this flavor, though it is a little pricier. \nThere are many more possibilities for flavored vodkas that you might want to try as well. Mix a chi-chi up with raspberry, citrus, or one of the whipped cream vodkas for an extra layer of flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Chi-Chi?\nIt's more difficult to estimate the alcohol content of blended drinks than it is regular cocktails because there are so many factors involved. The amount of ice, ice cream, and fruit you add will affect the drink's final strength. Yet, on average, you can expect the chi-chi to weigh in around 9 percent ABV (18 proof) when made with 80-proof vodka.

You can also place the rinsed pitcher in the dishwasher or add a bit of soap and hot water to the pitcher, give it a whirl on the blender base, then rinse it out.\nWhen using fresh pineapple, you will want to add more ice.

Try the coco colada recipe, which simply blends pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and ice.\nFor more of a smoothie, add a scoop of ice cream.\nUnsweetened coconut cream is a great alternative to the milk; it simply doesn't have as much water. Cream of coconut is sweetened and richer and preferred for the original pi?a colada.\nUse coconut or palm sugar instead of brown sugar. If using a hard, cake-like form of either sugar, crush it with a mortar and pestle or muddler into a consistency like brown sugar.\nLiquid sweeteners are good options as well.

Though it's often blamed on the rum because it's produced from sugar, the liquor has no more calories or sugar than vodka. The bigger culprit is the cream.

To consume, take the shot of whiskey and follow it with the shot of pickle juice.\nTip\nMany people have found that a beer chaser is a perfect way to finish up the pickleback, though it's not required. If you'd like to give it a try, stick with the light, refreshing lagers. Dos Equis, Tecate, and Pabst Blue Ribbon are some of the top choices among pickleback fans.\nThe Irish Whiskey\nThe key to making a great pickleback really is in the whiskey. You can pour any Irish whiskey?or any other whiskey, for that matter?but it will not be the same as a shot of Jameson. Maybe it's this particular whiskey's woody sweetness or something else entirely. It's hard to explain why, but Jameson creates the best tasting pickleback.\nWhile Jameson is not the original whiskey, it is the most popular today, and likely led to the shot's success. Cunningham's first round (or 10 rounds, according to his account) of the pickleback actually used Old Crow. This is good news if you want a pickleback and want to save money. It's not quite as tasty as Jameson, but it's pretty good.\nThe Pickle Juice\nAs stringent as you should be about the whiskey, there's no need to be picky about the pickle juice. The brine from any jar of pickles will work. Go ahead and pour from that commercially produced jar or your favorite homemade pickles?the shot will be just as good either way.\nThe pickle juice is also where you can have some fun. Bartenders around the country have played with a variety of pickle bases to great success. Some bars even stock up to 10 jars for this exact purpose. Try fruity brines, spicy brines, or something in between to see which you like best. If you want to keep it authentic, McClure's is the brand of pickles Cunningham used and recommends.\nHow Strong Is a Pickleback?\nSince you're not mixing the whiskey with the pickle juice, but chasing it, your pickleback is no different than a straight shot of whiskey. If you use Jameson, it will be an 80-proof shot (40 percent ABV). The pickle juice just adds more content to your stomach, which may slow down the alcohol's effects and help prevent a hangover (unless you overdo it, of course).\n10 Best Keto Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-a-pickleback-shot-4156982

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTransparent drinks such as the tequila collins do not have many heavy flavors to mask a poor quality spirit. That means that it's best to use a tequila that you would not mind sipping straight. Remember that the tequila you choose will determine the overall quality of the drink, so it is best to start it off right. Blanco (or silver) tequilas are the most popular choice for this recipe, though upgrading to an aged reposado is also an excellent idea.\nFresh lemon juice should be considered a requirement for making a great tequila collins (or any collins drink, for that matter). If you like, switch to lime juice or use a lemon wedge for the garnish so you can squeeze a bit more juice in as you drink.\nAgave nectar is often paired with tequila in cocktails because the two agave-based ingredients just seem to work better together. If you do not have agave nectar, simple syrup is an option. You may find that 3/4 ounce syrup is a better fit as the nectar tends to be sweeter than syrup.\nIf using straight cane sugar, start with 1 teaspoon and adjust it to your taste.\nAs with all sweet and sour cocktails, adjust those two elements to fit your personal taste. You might also find that you prefer a little more lemon with one tequila and a bit less with another. The fantastic part about the tequila collins is that you can adjust it as you drink. If it's not quite right, add to it, stir, and enjoy!\nHow Strong Is the Tequila Collins?\nLike other highball mixed drinks, estimating the amount of alcohol in the tequila collins is a bit of a challenge. That's because you may pour more or less soda than someone else and this single factor will change the potency of the drink. For example, if you pour an 80-proof tequila and finish the drink with about 2 ounces of soda, the drink is around 11 percent ABV (22 proof). This means that it is slightly stronger than the average glass of wine. That's why it is an ideal candidate for happy hour and casual drinking.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/juan-collins-recipe-760837

Any Caribbean rum would be a good option, though. Just like tequila, in Spanish-speaking countries, white rum might be labeled ""blanco.""\nAs with any daiquiri, the Hemingway is best with fresh-squeezed juice. You can typically get 1/2 to 1 ounce of juice out of the average lime, which is enough for one or two drinks. A grapefruit often yields 5 ounces of juice or more, so a single fruit should be plenty for a few rounds.\nRecipe Variation\nMaraschino is a cherry liqueur with a bitter-dry taste. If you need a substitute, Cherry Heering is your best bet. Stay away from supersweet cherry liqueurs as they will throw off the daiquiri\'s balance of flavors.\nFor more of an authentic Havana feel, strain the daiquiri over crushed ice.\nIf you\'d like to serve this cocktail frozen, just add 3/4 to 1 cup of ice to a blender with the other ingredients.\nHow to Drink Like Hemingway\nErnest Hemingway\'s drinking habits are almost as fascinating and famous as his writing. There are many stories about how often he drank and his favorite cocktails?the book ""To Have and Have Another: A Hemingway Cocktail Companion"" by Philip Greene is dedicated to the subject. He was quite selective about what he imbibed and often wrote about drinking in stories, journals, and letters. For instance, Hemingway\'s memoir, ""A Moveable Feast"" (posthumously published in 1964), includes countless tales of sharing drinks with literary friends while in Paris.\nIncluded in the many cocktails that Hemingway enjoyed are the daiquiri, whiskey and soda, martini, gin and tonic, and Campari drinks like the Negroni and Americano. He was fond of absinthe and is credited with creating the death in the afternoon?a simple mix of absinthe and Champagne. He preferred all of his drinks ice cold and not sweet?not just as a matter of taste but apparently also because of inherited diabetes concerns.\nThough he never drank while writing (and claimed to recognize when William Faulkner started drinking in that writer\'s work), his drinks were strong, and he often binged. It\'s said that his own version of the Papa Doble was a double shot of rum, the juice of two limes and one grapefruit, and six drops of maraschino; apparently, he once drank 17 of these in one day. While you might explore the drinks Hemingway preferred, it\'s not recommended to drink like him in terms of volume.\nHow Strong Is a Hemingway Daiquiri?\nFresh-made, shaken daiquiris are not light cocktails, and the Hemingway is no different.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe is best when made with a very smooth Canadian whisky.\nChoose a peach liqueur or schnapps with a very sweet, full-peach flavor for this recipe. The liqueur serves as a sweetener, taking the place of any sugar or syrups that are common in sweet tea.\nTo make this drink by the pitcher, increase the ingredients in proportion. For a 60 ounce pitcher, combine 1 1/4 cups (10 ounces) each of the whisky and peach liqueur and 5 cups (40 ounces) of iced tea. Mix and keep it chilled, then pour into ice-filled glasses.\nRecipe Variations\nThis iced tea recipe is an excellent use for peach-flavored whiskey. Look for peach whiskey from brands like Crown Royal, Jim Beam, Ole Smoky, and Revel Stoke. You can keep the peach liqueur for double the fruit flavor or switch to another sweetener, such as simple syrup.\nAdd sparkle with a splash of club soda or ginger ale.\nSplit the tea with an equal part of lemonade for a fun twist on the spiked Arnold Palmer.\nIf you'd like to take a break from whiskey, pour a shot of rum, tequila, or vodka in this cocktail instead.\nHow Strong Is the Summer Peach Tea?\nA smooth, slow sipper, this summer peach tea is a rather mild cocktail, which is why it is so perfect for a spring or summer afternoon. When made with an 80-proof whisky, it should fall in the 9 percent ABV (18 proof) range. It's similar to drinking a light glass of wine, only fruitier and more refreshing.\nWhich Type of Tea Makes the Best Iced Tea?\nThe iced tea can transform this drink into an entirely different experience every time. Begin with your favorite tea blend for iced tea, then play with it to bring in various flavor profiles. Black teas are a good universal place to begin, offering that classic iced tea taste. Green teas have more of a vegetal profile, while herbal teas (or tisanes) create a lighter foundation with a floral aspect.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/summer-peach-tea-cocktail-recipe-761506

If you prefer chilled cocktails, stir it with ice in a mixing glass and strain it into a cocktail glass. Enjoy.\nWhat Is Vermouth?\nVermouth is a fortified wine flavored with botanicals and herbs, originally developed as a medicinal tonic. Served as an aperitif or as part of cocktails, vermouth can also be used in cooking, but because its flavor is pretty forward, it has to be added with caution so not to overpower other flavors in the dish.\n\nAlso known as rosso, Italian vermouth is traditionally sweet and brownish red in color. French vermouth, used in the martini, is dry and clear. Sweet vermouth was actually developed a couple of decades before dry vermouth. As with gin, each brand of sweet vermouth will have a different character as different herbs are used.\nMake It Your 'It' Cocktail\nHere is some expert advice on serving a beautiful and flavorful cocktail:\nThe ratio of gin to sweet vermouth varies wildly in older recipes. Some have equal parts of sweet vermouth and gin, and some even have a 4-to-1 ratio of sweet vermouth to gin. However, it is more common nowadays to see recipes where there is more gin than vermouth. This recipe is 1-to-2 sweet vermouth to gin. Feel free to change up the ratio to one that suits your taste.\nSome recipes add a dash of orange bitters, which is advisable if these are the kind of flavors you gravitate toward when ordering a cocktail.\nThe odd number of cherries suggested is not just a random choice. Traditionally, you should use either one or three cherries, never an even number as it's believed to bring bad luck.\nHow Strong Is the Gin & It?\nLike the martini, the gin and it cocktail is not a light drink, which is why it is served short. The alcohol components are not diluted by any mixers. Sweet Italian vermouth is often 15 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). The cocktail already has 1.5 ounces of 80-proof gin, 40 percent ABV, which constitutes a standard drink. Put the two together and the cocktail weighs in right around 31 percent ABV, 62 proof. That is a strong beverage, so you should pace yourself when having this cocktail.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/gin-and-it-recipe-759299

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis is a cocktail where you want to pour the smoothest vodka in your bar. Use premium vodkas that you would typically enjoy on their own or in a vodka martini.\nEnsure that the quality of the triple sec matches that of your vodka. Spend a little more on a top-shelf brand; a high-end cura?ao works as well.\nFresh lime juice definitely produces a better-tasting kamikaze. You should be able to get 1 ounce of juice out of a whole lime and can simply squeeze it directly into the shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nAdjust the ratio to suit your taste. For instance, you might like a little more lime and prefer your kamikaze with 1 1/2 ounces of lime juice and just 1/2 ounce of the orange liqueur. Some people prefer it with equal parts of the three ingredients.\nTurn the kamikaze a pretty blue color by pouring blue cura?ao instead of triple sec.\nTry flavored vodka; almost any fruit infusion works, including berry, citrus, coconut, and pineapple. Vanilla vodka works well, too; it\'ll make it similar to the key lime pie martini without the pineapple.\nAnother popular variation is a ""SoCo"" kamikaze, in which the vodka is replaced with Southern Comfort.\nWhere Was the Kamikaze Invented?\nThe kamikaze\'s origins can be traced to an American naval base in Japan after World War II. It didn\'t become really popular until the 1970s, though. In his book ""Cocktail"" (which inspired the Tom Cruise movie), writer Heywood Gould calls it a classic disco-era cocktail invented by teenagers. For years, the kamikaze was primarily served as a shot and often employed sweetened lime juice (particularly Rose\'s). Bartenders eventually found that fresh lime juice creates a more enjoyable mix, and the cocktail version became a popular addition to modern martini menus.\nWhy Is It Called a Kamikaze Drink?\nIn Japanese, the word kamikaze translates to ""divine wind."" It initially referred to the typhoon that the Mongols were met with while trying to invade Japan in the 13th century. It\'s also often erroneously attributed to a name used by the Japanese military for its pilots and their missions?although it seems they later adopted the phrase despite the fact that the word used for their pilots was slightly different. It\'s most likely that the drink took on the name due to its origins in Japan, bold flavors, and alcohol kick.\nHow Strong Is a Kamikaze Cocktail?\nThe kamikaze is among the strongest cocktails, weighing in around 25 percent ABV (50 proof). That\'s typical of drinks in this style and over half the strength of the vodka itself. If you want to avoid a hangover, think twice about mixing up another round.\nDragon Fruit Martini Recipe']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/kamikaze-cocktail-recipe-759313

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nMake this martini with your favorite gin and be sure to explore various brands and styles. The classic London dry gin always offers a great taste, but there are many craft gins available that would be fantastic in this drink as well. Some of the softer gins may actually work better against the maraschino than the juniper-forward options.\nIt\'s easy to treat vermouth like it\'s a liqueur because it\'s so essential in the bar. In fact, it\'s a fortified wine and has a much shorter shelf life. If your bottle of dry vermouth has been open for longer than three months and was not stored in the refrigerator, it\'s best to replace it. You will see a big improvement in all of your martinis.\nUnless you have real maraschino cherries, it\'s best to avoid the temptation to garnish this drink with the average neon red maraschino. They\'re bleached and packed in a syrup that will leech into the drink and throw it off balance.\nRecipe Variations\nJust like the martini, this recipe is best when you adapt it to your personal taste. You can, for instance, pour less vermouth to make it ""drier"" or go with equal parts gin and vermouth, like the 50-50 martini. Also, feel free to shake it if you prefer or switch to vodka for a simple twist on the vodka martini.\nSome people may also enjoy a little more maraschino, so try doubling the liqueur to 1/4 ounce or triple it with a full 1/2-ounce pour.\nCherry Heering is one of the best substitutes for maraschino. You drink will be a little sweeter while lacking that bitter almond tone for which maraschino is known. The switch will also give the drink a slight red color.\nKirsch is another good substitute that retains maraschino\'s clear color and gentle bitterness. It\'s definitely not as sweet as the other two cherry liqueurs.\nHow Strong Is an Imperial Cocktail?\nMartinis may be sophisticated drinks, but they are not light on the alcohol. On average, you can expect your imperial cocktail to fall in the 27 percent ABV (58 proof) range. That\'s pretty potent and, while you may not feel tipsy after the first round, subsequent drinks can catch you by surprise.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/imperial-martini-recipe-759310

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nChoose a good Champagne because it contributes to the majority of the flavor.\nFor this and all Champagne cocktails, it is best to add the Champagne at the very last minute. Open the bottle right before serving for the freshest bubbles and the best visual effect as the sugar cube dissolves.\nFor faster service at a party, prepare all of the glasses you need with everything except the Champagne. Once the bottle is open, start pouring down the line of glasses.\nHow Strong Is the Champagne Cocktail?\nThe alcohol content of wine varies, though 12 percent ABV is average and can be used to estimate the cocktail's strength. Assuming you pour 4 ounces of Champagne, your drink would weigh in around 17 percent ABV (34 proof). Even with an 80-proof brandy, it's a relatively light drink in the cocktail world. The wine scene is another matter and in that context, it's pretty hefty.\nRecipe Variations\nAs you might imagine, a drink as old and popular as the Champagne cocktail has inspired a number of new renditions. If you just can't stop mixing your Champagne, give one of these recipes a try:\nThe Champagne (or diamond) fizz is similar to the popular gin fizz, though it uses champagne rather than soda water. Choose a nice London dry gin and a brut Champagne and add an egg white if you like. To make it, shake 2 ounces gin, 1 ounce fresh lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon sugar with ice. Strain into a highball glass filled with ice before topping it with Champagne.\nThe Woodford Reserve Champagne cocktail replaces brandy with bourbon and opts for a vanilla sweetener. To make the drink, pour 1 ounce Woodford Reserve into a Champagne flute with 1/2 ounce vanilla simple syrup, then top with 4 ounces Korbel Champagne. It recommends a vanilla bean garnish, which is a stunning (though expensive) touch.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/champagne-cocktail-recipe-759288

You may only need 4 ounces or as much as 6 ounces.\nThe average can of Red Bull is 8.4 ounces, though it's also sold in 12-ounce cans. That means you can likely get two drinks out of one can, so go ahead and mix one up for a friend.\nWant to put on more of a show while mixing the Colt 45? Try rolling the drink rather than stirring it. Pouring the liquid between two mixing glasses is a great bartending skill to learn. When you get really good at it, you can extend the length of your pour as long as your arms reach without spilling a drop.\nRecipe Variations\nRed Bull used to be a one-flavor drink, but that's not the case anymore. You can now find it in many flavors, from lime to kiwi apple, so experiment with your options to put a fun twist on the Colt 45.\nIf gin is not your thing, feel free to mix up this drink with vodka instead; it will be more like a J?ger-spiked vodka Red Bull. No matter what you call it, it's important that you enjoy what you're drinking.\nAny other energy drink can also be used to make a Colt 45. If you prefer the taste of one of the other options available, substitute it for the Red Bull. The flavor will be different, of course, but the effect will be the same.\nHow Strong Is This Drink?\nThe Colt 45 is a tall drink that's mostly made up of Red Bull, so it's probably not as strong as you may think. In fact, when made according to the recipe, its alcohol content is only 13 percent ABV (26 proof), similar to a glass of wine. Yet, as with many mixed drinks like this, the energy drink can mask the intoxicating and sedative effects of the liquor. So, while you may feel like you can drink it all night, sooner or later the liquor's going to catch up with you.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/colt-45-cocktail-recipe-760071

A few, however, require a bit more explanation...\nThe Red Wine. As with any sangria, the choice of wine is not going to make a big difference in the final drink. There is a lot going on here, so you are simply looking for a good background to build flavors on.\nKarl recommends 'something dry and spicy, like a Chianti or a dark red blend -- I used Franklin Hill Vineyard's Trio.' I followed her Chianti suggestion and it was perfect.\nJagermeister Spice Liqueur. Jagermeister Spice is the brand's first expansion beyond their famous herbal liqueur.

Essentially it is a combination of spices that we typically associate with the winter months. It often includes allspice, anise, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, vanilla and orange peel. Other ingredients like apples, ginger, figs and raisins can also be included.\nThere is no right or wrong way to put together a sachet of mulling spices and you should feel free to use any of those ingredients that you like. I consider cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and orange essential to my mulled recipes and will add others depending on the drink.\nCreating a Spice Sachet. There are many ways to create the sachet itself. I prefer to contain everything as much as possible because it is easier to retrieve from the liquid. Cinnamon sticks are easy to remove, so I simply let them float.\nAn easy spice sachet:\nPlace the mulling spices in a small piece of cheesecloth or empty loose leaf tea bag.\nTie a knot in the cloth.\nFor easy retrieval, place a small sachet in a tea ball or a similar infuser with a chain. Alternatively, tie a piece of (clean) string around a larger pouch.\nHang the chain or string over the side of the container so you can easily grab it to remove the spice pouch.\nWhen in doubt, use a ladle to remove the sachet.\nHow Strong Is the Winter Warmer Mulled Sangria?\nFresh fruits make it a little more difficult to estimate the strength of a drink, but we can get a rough idea of how strong this sangria is.\n\nThe liqueurs are lower proof, so they do not add much alcohol to the drink either.

Both fruits tend to yield the perfect amount of juice the recipe calls for.\nIf you really want to step up your game, try the drink with homemade grenadine. It is very easy to make because it\'s essentially a simple syrup made with pomegranate juice rather than water. You can even use the fresh fruit when it\'s in season (typically late fall and early winter).\nToss that jar of neon red maraschinos and replace it with real maraschino cherries instead.

Serve and enjoy.\nWho Created the Pi?a Colada?\nThe Pi?a Colada\'s origin is one of the few cocktail histories that is well documented. The cocktail was created in 1954 by Ram?n ""Monchito"" Marrero, bartender at the Beachcomber Bar in the Caribe Hilton of San Juan, Puerto Rico. The original recipe was nonalcoholic and shaken. His intent was to welcome guests with a taste of the tropics captured in a glass. Monchito added a local rum a number of years later, and the drink found a second home in the blender. In 1978, the Pi?a Colada became Puerto Rico\'s official drink.\n\nOver the following decades, the cocktail was enjoyed by Caribbean travelers who brought tales of it home. It was not until the release of Rupert Holmes\' 1979 hit song ""Escape"" that the drink skyrocketed in popularity. Don\'t recognize the title? It is also called?quite appropriately?""The Pi?a Colada Song."" If you need a reminder of it, just stop by someplace hosting a karaoke night, and you\'re almost sure to hear it.\nFlavorful Additions and Substitutions\nThe Caribe Hilton\'s original Pi?a colada recipe is heavy on the pineapple and uses Bacardi rum and Coco Lopez: Mix 2 ounces of light rum, 1 ounce each of coconut cream and heavy cream, and 6 ounces of pineapple juice in a blender. Add 1/2 cup crushed ice and mix for 15 seconds, then pour into a 12-ounce glass and garnish with a pineapple and cherry.\nUse 5-6 ripe pineapple chunks instead of juice, cut them about 1 inch x 1 inch. It\'ll make for a fresher, brighter cocktail.\nAdd ¨ù-¨ö ounces of overproof Jamaican rum, such as Smith and Cross, to add an extra kick and an a layer of complexity.\nAdd a hint of background flavor with a flavored rum. Apricot, banana, grapefruit, kiwi, kumquat, orange, passion fruit, and vanilla pair great with both coconut and pineapple. If you can\'t find a particular rum flavor at the store, make your own rum infusions.\nSwitch the rum out for brandy and enjoy a kappa colada.\nMake a mocktail with the coco colada or a big-batch virgin pi?a colada recipe.\nAdd more ice for a thicker drink, or more pineapple juice (or less ice) for a thinner version.\nReplace the cream of coconut with full-fat or low-fat coconut milk for a lighter version.\nHow Strong Is a Frozen Pi?a Colada?\nNot only is the pi?a colada refreshing, but it\'s also low-proof. All that ice adds volume and brings the alcohol content down significantly, so this recipe averages out at just 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That\'s right between beer and wine, only this drink is far more delicious.\nThe Ultimate Cocktails Guide']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/frozen-pina-colada-recipe-759297

Should you decide to change up the whiskey, go with another Tennessee whiskey or a full-flavored bourbon.\nChoose a quality triple sec. Whatever you do, stay away from those $5 specials that are so common at the liquor store. They're too sweet and unnaturally flavored to do any cocktail any good.\nFresh lemon juice really does make the best Lynchburg lemonade. One average lemon should yield enough juice for two drinks. Let it reach room temperature and roll it under the palm of your hand on the counter to maximize the juice.\nThe choices for lemon-lime soda are vast. Sprite, 7-Up, and Sierra Mist are all popular options. If you want a splash of something really interesting, try Q Drinks Lemon or Fever-Tree Sparkling Lemon.\nRecipe Variations\nSome people prefer to use sour mix rather than lemon juice. This will make the drink slightly sweeter, but with a premium triple sec, that shouldn't throw the drink's flavor balance off too much.\nQuickly transform this recipe into a tasty party punch by mixing 1 part each of whiskey, lemon juice, and triple sec with 4 parts soda in a punch bowl.

On average, its alcohol content is around 8 percent ABV (16 proof), which is a little lighter than a glass of wine. However, this drink has been known to get people drunker than they expected. Other than drinking too many, the problem often comes from overpouring the whiskey.

Dissolve the sugar in the boiling water, stirring constantly.\nOnce the sugar is dissolved completely, reduce the heat, cover, and allow to simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes (the more sugar, the less simmering time).\nRemove the pan from the heat. Allow to cool completely and thicken, then bottle. Use in your favorite drink recipes. Store any excess in the fridge.\nTips\nDon\'t expect the syrup at either ratio to be as thick as maple syrup or honey. Instead, it will be thin and very easy to pour, with a consistency similar to that of a liqueur.\nThere are a few alternatives to using simple syrup. The most popular ones in the bar are gomme (gum) syrup and agave nectar. Molasses and honey (or honey syrup) are other options, though they should be used selectively in cocktails.\nIf you\'re substituting simple syrup for granulated sugar in a drink recipe, the general rule is to use 1/4 ounce syrup for 1 teaspoon of sugar. However, you may need up to 1/2 ounce syrup. \nTo prolong the shelf life, add a little vodka. Usually between a tablespoon and an ounce is enough, depending on how large the batch of syrup is.\nRecipe Variations\nThe easiest simple syrup to make is called ""bar simple syrup"" because it\'s a quick way for bartenders to make the sweetener. Simply combine equal parts (1:1) sugar and water in a bottle and shake it until the sugar is completely dissolved. The resulting syrup is a thinner (almost water-like) than a syrup that has been reduced by heat.\nReplacing white sugar with demerara sugar (a raw sugar) is a popular alternative because it has an even richer flavor. The drawback to using this light brown sugar is that it will alter the color of your cocktails slightly, but the taste makes up for it.\nYou can also use turbinado sugar, brown sugar, coconut sugar, or palm sugar.\nTo make a honey syrup, combine 1/3 cup of water and 1 cup of honey over low heat until dissolved.\nIf you are a fan of stevia or other alternatives to sugar, feel free to use those to make a simple syrup. They work just as well, though there is a bit of a flavor difference that you\'re probably used to if you use them regularly. Begin with a small batch of 1:1 simple syrup and see how you like it and make any adjustments from there.\nTo modify a sugar substitute like Sweet\'n Low syrup for a sugar-loving palate, add a teaspoon of vanilla extract. It reduces the bitter aftertaste, and this trick may work well with other sugar substitutes as well.\nSimple syrup can also be infused with flavor and used in a variety of drinks to add a unique twist. Try making homemade grenadine (a pomegranate-flavored simple syrup), sour mix (a lemon and lime-flavored syrup), lime cordial, spiced syrups like cardamom, ginger, or cinnamon simple syrup, jalape?o simple syrup, lavender syrup, coffee syrup, or vanilla syrup.\nHow to Use\nUse your homemade simple syrup to sweeten the following drinks and much, much more:\nDaiquiri\nMojito\nHurricane\nLemonade\nIced Tea\nCold-Brew Coffee\nHow Long Does a Simple Syrup Last?\nWhen stored in an airtight container or bottle in the fridge, simple syrup with last for at least three weeks and often more than a month.\nCan You Buy Simple Syrup?\nSimple syrup can often be found in bottles at liquor stores with an extensive mixers section, and you may find some flavored syrups as well.

For a little more grapefruit flavor, replace 1/2 ounce or so of water with extra juice.\nThe average grapefruit yields between 5 and 6 ounces of juice. If you were to use all of that for your grapefruit-ade, mix it with the same amount of simple syrup and about 10 ounces of water. You should end up with around 20 ounces of grapefruit ade, or enough for three or four grapefruit shandies.\nGrapefruits are big, so the average slice or half-moon is going to be an over-sized garnish for the typical beer glass. The best option is to cut each grapefruit slice into quarters.\nThe shandy is an English drink, while the radler has German roots. They're nearly identical (and the names are often used interchangeably), though the radler sometimes uses a citrus soda instead of lemonade. To make a grapefruit radler, split the water in the grapefruit-ade with club, lemon-lime, or grapefruit soda to create a sparkling grapefruit-ade.\nThough it's enjoyable without booze, some people like to add it to their shandy. For the grapefruit shandy, try a shot of grapefruit vodka or white rum.\nUse this recipe as inspiration for other flavored shandies. Try it with citrus fruits like orange or lime. Or, muddle a few strawberries or raspberries in the shaker while making the ade.\nIf you want to take a break from the beer or need a quick non-alcoholic drink, top the grapefruit-ade off with tonic water or a citrus soda.\nHow strong is a grapefruit shandy?\nThe grapefruit shandy will cut the alcohol content of your beer in half.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nOrange cura?ao is clear, and most other orange liqueurs will work as a substitute. The one exception is blue cura?ao, which will turn the sangria into a really dark, rather unsightly color.\nFresh-squeezed citrus juices make a better-tasting sangria over the bottled options. You'll want to stock up on fruit anyway because sangria is designed to be heavily garnished in both the pitcher and glass.\nIf you prefer to serve this from a pitcher, combine two parts of the sangria base with one part soda, adding large ice balls or cubes. Keep the remainder well-chilled and mix the two again when it's time to refill the pitcher.\nRecipe Variations\nSangria is one of those drinks that is only limited by your imagination. There are many sangria recipes for you to explore as well; some use white, ros?, or sparkling wine, some prefer tropical fruits or add fresh herbs, and others switch from brandy to another spirit. Use this recipe as inspiration to create your own custom sangria using these suggestions:\nRum is a common substitute for brandy in sangria. Whiskey is an interesting choice as well; choose bourbon or a smooth blended whiskey for best results. Tequila and vodka are often best reserved for white wine sangrias.\nUse 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and stir the sangria until it's completely dissolved. Agave nectar, honey syrup, and other liquid sweeteners are good simple syrup substitutes. Most require a little less; start with 2 ounces and add more to taste.\nSwitch to your favorite clear soda. Ginger ale is a favorite, lemon-lime soda adds a sweet brightness, and sparkling wine is always a fun option.\nFreeze fruits and herbs into an ice ring to dress up the punch bowl and keep the sangria cool.\nWhat Is the Best Wine for Sangria?\nChoose your favorite red wines for this sangria. You can even mix and match the two bottles. For instance, you might choose a jammy, full-bodied cabernet sauvignon and a dry, lighter-bodied pinot noir. You can also go the traditional route and choose Spanish wine; Rioja wines are an excellent choice. There's no need to spend a lot of money, either. Less expensive wines work well because the punch is so flavorful that it will cover up any characteristics that you may not enjoy otherwise.\nWhat Is the Best Brandy for Sangria?\nTo keep the sangria authentic, use a Spanish brandy, such as brandy de Jerez. However, at such a low volume, the brandy doesn't have a huge impact on sangria. Feel free to pour any brandy you have in the bar.\nHow Strong Is Sangria?\nEven though there's a lot of wine in sangria, it's typically a relatively light punch. This particular recipe, for example, mixes up to an alcohol content of just 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That means you'll be serving a beverage that's stronger than beer, lighter than wine, but with a lot more flavor.\nSummer Drinks & Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-sangria-recipe-759804

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIn order to get that amazing blueberry-like flavor, you really cannot play around with the ingredients too much. There is a variety of amaretto brands available, though it would be best to stick with a high-end label like Luxardo or Disaronno.\nIn contrast, there are not many great substitutes for Grand Marnier. While there are many orange liqueurs available, few have the cognac base that this drink requires. Don\'t try triple sec, Cointreau, or anything like that because they simply will not work.\nGranGala is the one brand that can be recommended as a Grand Marnier substitute. This one is from Italy and has a brandy rather than French cognac base. It\'s quite nice and you will find that it saves a little money, too.\nWhat Is Orange Pekoe Tea?\nOrange pekoe tea is not orange-flavored. Rather, it\'s the name for a specific grade of orthodox black tea. You will not get the ""blueberry"" flavor that makes the blueberry tea special with an orange-based tea. If you do not have orange pekoe tea in stock, substitute it with another black tea or a blend like Earl Grey (which does have a hint of citrus). In the least, use green tea or oolong tea in its place.\nHow to Brew Orange Pekoe Tea\nTo make the best blueberry tea possible, pay attention to your tea\'s water temperature and brewing time. For black teas, you will want water heated between 180 F and 212 F, just under a full boil. The brewing time should be 3 to 5 minutes, though it\'s always a good idea to follow the recommendation of the particular tea you\'re using.\nHow Strong Is the Blueberry Tea?\nGrand Marnier is an 80 proof liqueur, which makes it as strong as most vodkas, whiskeys, and rums. However, this drink has far more tea than liquor, so it\'s pleasantly mild.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo give the punch a lighter profile, use white cranberry juice. It\'s a perfect complement to the elderflower and allows the florals to shine a little brighter. Also, white cranberry is not quite as sweet as the more common red cranberry juice.\nLike sangrias, it\'s best to mix up the base of the punch and allow it to rest in the refrigerator overnight. This helps to marry the flavors and creates a more uniform taste. Yet, if you didn\'t plan ahead and need a quick punch right before the party, it will work out just fine.\nEven though this is called a ""Champagne punch,"" Champagne is not required. Whether it\'s Cava, Prosecco, or a bubbly ros?, your favorite sparkling wine will make a great punch. Just be sure to add it and the soda right before service so your guests can fully enjoy the bubbles.\nIce or No Ice?\nThere\'s no need to include ice in the punch if you chill all of the ingredients ahead of time. You can certainly add ice if you like and it\'s not a bad idea if it\'s a hot day.\nA simple ice ring always looks great in a punch bowl. It can be made with your bundt pan and you can even freeze fresh fruits inside. You do need to think ahead though. Large pieces of ice take longer to freeze, so try to give it at least 24 hours, if not longer.\nYou can also use large ice balls or freeze ice in nearly any large container that will fit in your bowl. Keep in mind that the larger your chunks of ice, the slower they will melt. For a party punch, it\'s always best to avoid the average-sized ice cubes that are in everyone\'s freezer.\nIf you want to avoid any chance of watering down your punch, place the punch bowl in a tray of ice. As the ice melts, simply dump the water and add more to keep the bowl cool.\nHow Strong Is a Cranberry Elderflower Champagne Punch?\nAll of the nonalcoholic mixers used in this punch offset the liqueur and wine, bringing the alcohol content down to a very pleasant level. Though it will vary, you can generally expect it to mix up to 7 percent ABV (14 proof).

It will have an extra effervescence that stirring doesn't provide.\nSince it's only a 1 1/2-ounce shooter, you can easily make three or four at one time. Just increase the ingredients proportionally, line up the shot glasses on your bar, and fill each glass, pouring down the line.\nTurn It Into a Cocktail\nThis recipe is so easy and such a delicious drink that you might just want to enjoy it as a taller cocktail. Sipping on the sweet mix of pineapple and melon is a fantastic way to enjoy happy hour or a summer afternoon on the patio. All you need to do is increase the recipe.\n\nStart with a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of vodka, then pour 3/4 ounce each of the melon liqueur and pineapple juice. Give the mix a good shake and strain it into a cocktail glass or over fresh ice in a highball glass. Topping it off with a little club soda or ginger ale is an excellent idea as well.\nWhat Type of Vodka Should I Use?\nShots are drunk quickly, so the choice of vodka is not as important in this drink as it would be in a cocktail. However, to help it go down smoother, it's always a good idea to choose your vodka wisely. The great news is that there are many great-tasting vodkas available that don't cost a fortune. From New Amsterdam to Svedka, it's rather easy to find a clean-tasting and budget-friendly vodka for drinks like this.\n\nIf you want to add a little extra flavor to your melon ball shots, pick a flavored vodka. Stick with fruit flavors like strawberry, raspberry, or citrus to add a new twist. Since the shot includes pineapple, a coconut vodka would be a lot of fun as well. It's also a good recipe for your favorite marshmallow vodka.\nHow Strong Is a Melon Ball Shot?\nThis shot not only tastes great, but it's also one of the lightest shooters you can mix up. On average, its alcohol content is just 17 percent ABV (34 proof), or slightly stronger than wine.

Since Midori is included and it's also green, you can get away with white cr?me de menthe, but dark cr?me de cacao will muddy it up.\nHalf-and-half is the perfect middle ground among your dairy choices for cocktails. Using cream will create a thicker drink and milk makes it much lighter.\nThis is one drink that is definitely much better in a frosty glass and the colder, the better. Stick your glasses in the freezer for half an hour or so for the deepest chill.\nRecipe Variation\nServe this cocktail on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass. It makes a tasty, slow-sipping dessert cocktail and becomes even more decadent with a little whipped cream and drizzle of chocolate.\nIt's not a bad idea to adjust the ingredients to suit your taste. Something as simple as increasing the cr?me de cacao to 1 ounce, then cutting the half-and-half to 1 1/2 ounces can make a big difference.\nIf you prefer, pour a non-dairy cream instead. Almond, rice, or soy milk are good options. Coconut milk may actually be a good choice to marry those unusual melon, mint, and chocolate flavors.\nHow Strong Is a Holiday Hopper?\nBeyond the sweet taste, this cocktail is also pleasantly light.

A good, inexpensive rum will work and if you don\'t have dark rum in stock, any rum will do.\nUse your favorite coffee liqueur or, if you\'re feeling crafty, make your own coffee liqueur.\nCr?me de cacao is a popular chocolate liqueur, and many brands produce it. The dark variety will add to the bushwacker\'s flavor and color, but the white version works just as well.\nRecipe Variations\nAdd as much ice as you like to change the bushwacker\'s consistency. You might even like to start with 1/2 cup (about 2 or 3 average-sized ice cubes), blend it up, and add more for a slushier drink.\nSkip the milk and use a scoop of ice cream instead; ice cubes can be added for volume.\nMake it dairy free by using vanilla soy milk or almond milk.\nThe recipe that some claim is the Sandshaker\'s original bushwacker uses 4 ounces each of cream of coconut, half-and-half, and vanilla ice cream, 2 ounces of coffee liqueur, 1 ounce each of black rum and both varieties of cr?me de cacao, and 2 cups of ice. It\'s blended, poured into two glasses, and each is topped with 1 ounce of 151-proof rum.\nSome bushwacker recipes use just vodka, while others combine vodka and coconut rum.\nAmaretto and Irish cream are often used together when they make an appearance in bushwackers.\nA small shot of triple sec can give any bushwacker a citrus twist that\'s quite delicious, particularly with vodka.\nBottled pi?a colada mix is sometimes used instead of cream of coconut. Adding the pineapple element takes away from the chocolate intention of this cocktail just a bit.\nHow to Store\nThis recipe can fill a tall hurricane glass or three smaller glasses. If you have leftovers, keep it frozen until you\'re ready for the next round.\nUse your freezer to store a party\'s worth of bushwackers that are prepared in advance. Just let the drinks warm up a bit?obviously, not enough to melt?before serving so they\'re drinkable.\nWhy Is It Called a Bushwacker?\nThe name ""bushwacker"" has a few meanings. It\'s often used in Australia and New Zealand for someone who lives in ""the bush."" In the U.S., it can refer to a person who wanders off the path in the woods. Historically, it was used to describe the American Civil War guerillas who didn\'t pick a side. This freewheeling, wild spirit may be why the cocktail picked up the name.\nWhere Was the Bushwacker Created?\nThe bushwacker cocktail\'s origin lies in the Virgin Islands. The story goes that the then-owner of the Sandshaker Lounge in Pensacola, Florida, enjoyed a drink called the bushwacker while visiting Sapphire Beach Village on the island of St. Thomas. Back in Florida, the staff at the Sandshaker devised their own take on the delicious cocktail, and it quickly became a hit. Today, bushwackers are enjoyed at bars far away from any ocean, and there are countless interpretations of the cocktail.\nHow Strong Is the Bushwacker?\nMost frozen cocktails are generally low-proof drinks. This bushwacker weighs in at about 6 percent ABV (12 proof), but it is easy to overindulge. It can become too strong when the liquor is overpoured and the sweet taste brings you back for more. It\'s also important to keep in mind that frozen drinks are often enjoyed in the hot sun by drinkers who don\'t eat enough food to absorb the alcohol. Take it easy with delicious drinks like this, and be sure to drink plenty of water when partying in the summer.\nCookies and Cream Milkshake Recipe']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bushwacker-cocktail-recipe-760503

Each liqueur has a specific gravity that will determine whether it can float on top of another. The rule of thumb is that the heavier liqueur goes on the bottom. Butterscotch schnapps is one of the heaviest ingredients in the bar because it is filled with sugar.\nRecipe Variations\nTo shake this shot, combine the two liqueurs in a cocktail shaker filled with ice, shake well, then strain into a shot glass.\nThe shaken version also makes an excellent dessert drink when you double the recipe and serve it on the rocks. It's fabulous with cheesecake and other lightly indulgent sweets.\nThe butterball #3 uses a different flavor of schnapps. To make it, pour 1 ounce of peach schnapps into a shot glass and float 1/2 ounce of Irish cream liqueur on top. Again, you can shake it if you like.\nThe golden butterball adds Goldschl?ger and gets its name from the gold flakes found in the cinnamon schnapps. For this one, pour 1/2 ounce each of the cinnamon schnapps and butterscotch schnapps into a shot glass. Slowly pour 1/2 ounce of Irish cream liqueur on top so it floats.\nOne similar shot that went by the licorice ball's former name and was dubbed recipe #3 layers 1/3 ounce each of Kahl?a coffee liqueur, butterscotch schnapps, and Irish cream in a shot glass in the order given. \nHow Strong Is a Butterball?\nThe layered butterscotch schnapps and Irish cream have an alcohol content of 25 percent ABV (50 proof), and the other versions will be similar. That's over half the strength of a straight shot of tequila. Keep this in mind because these may taste great, but a few rounds can quickly add up and may lead to a wicked hangover.\nIs Butterscotch Liqueur the Same as Butterscotch Schnapps?\nButterscotch schnapps is a butterscotch-flavored liqueur?the two are one in the same. The sweet, buttery liqueur is often used in mixed drinks and shots.\nDo You Have to Refrigerate Butterscotch Schnapps?\nButternut schnapps does not need to be refrigerated?store the liqueur in a cool, dry, dark place. Even after opened, it will keep almost indefinitely under the right conditions. Discard schnapps if it acquires an off smell.\n11 Fun Layered Party Shots That Go Down Smooth""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/buttery-nipple-recipe-759610

To create a thicker shake, add more ice cream. If it's too thick, add more RumChata.\nPour the blended shake into the prepared frozen glass.\nGarnish with a toasted marshmallow and chocolate shavings. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis recipe can easily be divided into two shorter glasses and it looks great in a cocktail glass. Splitting it also gives you the opportunity to make any personal adjustments to the recipe in a second round.\nWhen it comes to the chocolate liqueur, you have quite a few options. Cr?me de cacao is a good choice and either the white or dark versions may already be in your bar. If you want to get decadent, pour a creamy chocolate liqueur such as Godiva.\nTo crush graham crackers, chop them in a blender or food processor. You can also place them into a plastic zipper bag and smash them into fine pieces using a rolling pin, cocktail muddler, or any blunt object you have in the kitchen. The smaller the bits, the better for rimming the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you'd like to skip the task of rimming, sprinkle crushed graham crackers over the drink after adding the marshmallow. You can also add shaved chocolate, mini chocolate chips, or a drizzle of chocolate syrup to the top instead of (or along with) the syrup in the glass.\nMarshmallow vodka is the obvious choice for any s'mores cocktail and this is the perfect excuse to pick up a bottle. If you prefer, try vanilla or whipped cream vodka instead.\nRather than Drambuie, pour B?renj?ger instead. You can also simply use 1 tablespoon of honey.\nWhile vanilla ice cream is recommended, there's no reason you can't switch it up. Options include splitting it with chocolate ice cream, using a fun flavor like rocky road, or even switching to chocolate chip ice cream.\nThe Toasted Marshmallows\nYou don't need a campfire to roast marshmallows and there are a few ways to make them right there in your kitchen. Be careful not to start a kitchen fire, of course. \nIf you have a culinary torch, you can toast them with that.\nUse the burner on a gas stove by skewering the marshmallows and holding them a few inches from the flame.\nTurn on the broiler of your oven, place the marshmallows on a pan 2 to 3 inches from the flame. Watch carefully as it should take just a minute or two to get the perfect char.\nOf course, if you have a fire or the grill going, nothing beats a roasted marshmallow over either of those.\nGlass Bakeware Warning\nDo not use glass bakeware when broiling or when a recipe calls to add liquid to a hot pan, as glass may explode. Even if it states oven-safe or heat resistant, tempered glass products can, and do, break occasionally.\nHow Strong Is a Boozy S'mores Milkshake?\nWith four liquors and only ice cream to knock it down, this is one of the strongest blended cocktails you can mix up.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPour a good vodka that you wouldn't mind drinking straight. With just three ingredients, there's nothing in this cocktail that can mask a vodka's impurities.\nThe same attention to quality should be applied to the tonic water; many available tonics are as well crafted as any liquor. Explore brands such as Q Drinks and Fentimans and try out the different formulas available. For instance, Fever-Tree offers more than five tonics and each will give the drink a unique undertone.\nAdd as little or as much lime juice as you like. Some drinkers prefer just a squeeze of a lime wedge while others enjoy 1/4 ounce of juice or more. You can even wipe the glass rim with the garnish. In any case, fresh-squeezed juice will produce a cleaner taste than bottled lime juice.\nRecipe Variations\nGive the drink a little extra dimension by pouring your favorite flavored vodka. Citrus vodkas are a natural choice, though berries are an excellent option as well.\nSwitch the citrus juice and garnish to either lemon or orange, or double up and use a combination of two citrus fruits.\nAdd half a shot of a fruit liqueur. Mango liqueurs give the drink a tropical touch, and the fruit pairs nicely with tonic.\nMuddle fruit in the glass before mixing the drink. Strawberry tonics are delightful, though nearly any fruit is a good choice.\nHow Strong Is the Vodka Tonic?\nLike any tall drink, you can make the vodka tonic as strong as you like by pouring more or less tonic.

For instance, you might like this drink with a grapefruit soda such as Squirt or Fresca or a lemon-lime soda like Sprite or 7-Up.\nTake a few minutes to squeeze fresh orange juice because it always makes for better drinks. The average orange will produce about 2 to 3 ounces of orange juice, which is enough for one to two drinks. To get more juice out of an orange, warm it up and roll it firmly against a hard surface before you squeeze it.\nRecipe Variation\nIt's easy to mix up a pitcher of rum and dews to serve several guests so you're not stuck making drinks all day. Simply keep the ratio at 1:1:2. For example, to make a batch of eight servings, combine 1 1/2 cups spiced rum, 1 1/2 cups orange juice, and 3 cups soda.\nTo retain the soda's fizz, make it up immediately before serving. \nIt's better to add ice to the glasses rather than the pitcher.\nIf you want to prepare it ahead of time, mix the rum and orange juice in the pitcher, then add the soda before you pour the individual drinks.\nHow Strong Is a Rum and Dew?\nThe rum and dew is a relatively gentle drink which is why it's great for casual sipping on lazy days and for happy hour.

That granulated sugar you use every day in the kitchen does not stick as well because the crystals are larger.\nTip\nAll you need is a food processor to transform granulated sugar into superfine sugar!\nAbou-Ganim makes a brief reference to cinnamon-sugar on his website. It is a nice addition that is very enjoyable. To add this special touch, simply mix ground cinnamon with your sugar before applying it to the rim.\nHow to Make Fresh Lemon Sour\nAbou-Ganim's recipe calls for a fresh lemon sour. It is very easy to make and focuses on lemon rather than the lemon-lime combination used in the standard sour mix.\nWhile the average sour mix will work, this lemon sour is strongly preferred for a Cable Car.\n1 part simple syrup\n2 parts fresh lemon juice\nCombine the ingredients into a container with a tight seal and shake well.\nSour Mix Tips:\nMake as small or large of a batch as you like.\nFor example: To make 1 cup of lemon sour, mix 1/2 cup simple syrup with 1 cup lemon juice. This will make about 5 Cable Cars.\nThe average lemon yields about 1 3/4 ounces of juice. You will need about five lemons for 1 cup of lemon sour. We recommend using a hand or electric juicer to make easy work of it.\nHow Strong Is the Cable Car?\nUsing the exact measurements and brands that the Cable Car was designed for, we can estimate this cocktail to be about 18 percent ABV (36 proof).\nRum Swizzle Cocktail""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cable-car-cocktail-with-spiced-rum-760596

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nThough white rum is the preferred style for this drink, try it with an aged rum to give the drink a little more depth.\nFresh-squeezed orange juice is highly recommended. The average orange yields 2 to 3 ounces, so you\'ll have more than enough juice from a single fruit for a few cocktails.\nGrenadine is easy to find at grocers and liquor stores as it\'s a popular syrup for a variety of drinks, including the tequila sunrise and Shirley Temple.\nIf you really enjoy cocktails sweetened with grenadine, consider making it from scratch. Homemade grenadine is as easy as creating a flavored syrup with pomegranate juice, though you can also use the fresh fruit when it\'s in season.\nRecipe Variations\nThough it won\'t have the ""Cuban"" touch, vodka and tequila are both great alternatives for this cocktail.\nYou can also give this drink the ""sunrise"" touch. Pour only the rum and orange juice in the shaker, strain the drink, then add the grenadine to the glass.

During the autumn months, it's relatively easy to find freshly pressed cider at apple orchards and in grocery stores, where it's typically found chilled in the produce department.\nFor the ginger liqueur, Domaine de Canton is a nice option and one of the easiest to find. The King's Ginger is another excellent liqueur that's worth hunting down.\nVelvet falernum is a syrup flavored with lime, clove, and other ingredients, often including ginger and almond. John D. Taylor is the most popular option and it's actually a low-proof liqueur. Other companies, including Fee Brothers (makers of a popular line of bitters) and Tippleman's offer a nonalcoholic falernum syrup that is a good substitute.\nRecipe Variations\nA flavored simple syrup can be a good substitute for the falernum, especially considering it's just a splash in this martini. Try complementary flavors for the apple cider, like cinnamon syrup or a spiced brown sugar syrup.\nFlavored vodkas are always an option in martinis. For this recipe, think about pouring a vanilla vodka, which would be absolutely perfect. Pear or herb or spice vodkas (e.g., rosemary or cinnamon) would be interesting as well, especially if you do your own infusion.\nFor a totally different spirit, pour cacha?a instead of vodka. The sweet rum-like spirit is a perfect pairing for apple cider.\nApple juice can be used as a substitute for apple cider. The biggest difference between the two is that the juice is filtered to help with preservation, so it doesn't quite have the rich, raw apple flavor.\nHow Strong Is an Apple Cider Martini?\nNot only is this martini delicious, but it's also pretty light on the alcohol compared to other vodka martinis. On average, it's going to weigh in around 17 percent ABV (34 proof), or slightly stronger than a glass of wine.\nRum Swizzle Cocktail""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/apple-cider-martini-recipe-760932

Add rums, falernum, and juices.\nHolding a swizzle stick or bar spoon between your palms, spin shaft to churn mix vigorously until glass is frosty.\nTop with more crushed ice and add a few dashes of bitters.\nGarnish with an orange slice, pineapple wedge, and cherry. Serve with a straw and enjoy.\nTips\nThe amount of ice needed is not exact, but you will need a lot of crushed ice for swizzle drinks. Count on at least 10 average-sized ice cubes to make two cups of crushed ice. An ice crusher (whether electric or manual) makes it a quick task, and a blender works, though you'll need to strain off excess water.\nWhenever possible, use fresh juice. One orange and half a lemon should work out perfectly for a single drink. Juicing fresh pineapple is worth the effort but not as critical to the drink.\nIncrease the recipe to make two to four drinks at once: Swizzle it in a mixing glass or small pitcher, pour the mix equally into serving glasses, then top each with ice, bitters, and the garnishes of your choice.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch from falernum to grenadine, orgeat syrup, or simple syrup.\nPlay around with different rum combinations. For instance, some swizzles call for aged and blackstrap rums and some for light and aged rums. Spiced rum can give the drink a good boost, too.\nLikewise, explore the difference a change in bitters can make. There are fascinating flavors of bitters available, and each can add a subtle twist to any swizzle.\nAdd 1/2 ounce of triple sec. Other fruit liqueurs will yield interesting results, and ginger liqueur would add a sweet spice to the mix.\nWhere was the rum swizzle invented?\nAs with many cocktails, there are several stories about the rum swizzle's origins. All of them point to the Caribbean islands, and most come from Bermuda. You can find rum swizzles at nearly every bar on the island, though they're all a little different. One of the most adamant claims to the rum swizzle's creation comes from the Swizzle Inn; the rum swizzle made its debut there around the establishment's 1932 opening. Today, their swizzle is a shaken drink similar to this recipe made with Gosling's Black Seal and Gold Seal Rums and triple sec.\nWhat is falernum?\nFalernum is a sweet liqueur (sometimes a nonalcoholic syrup) that is primarily flavored with cloves and lime. It often includes almonds and ginger, along with other spices. The liqueur variety typically has a rum base. Also called velvet falernum, it is a popular ingredient in tropical cocktail recipes.\nHow Strong Is the Rum Swizzle?\nPouring two rums may lead you to believe that this is a potent drink. However, swizzling significantly dilutes the mix, and the juices outweigh the liquor. It's hard to get an accurate estimate because of the ice, but the rum swizzle's alcohol content should fall in the 10 percent ABV (20 proof) range. That's similar to highball drinks or a glass of wine.\nRum Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rum-swizzle-cocktail-recipe-5185155

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nDouble straining will help keep bits of berry out of your finished drink. It's also very easy and means that you'll pour the drink through a fine mesh strainer while using your regular cocktail strainer.\nA single lime typically yields between 1/2 and 1 ounce of juice. Depending on the size and juiciness of your lime, you may need more than one for this cocktail.\nTo maximize the juice of your lime, let it warm to room temperature then roll it under the palm of your hand before cutting it in half.\nBefore adding the lemon peel garnish to your cocktail, give the peel a gentle squeeze over the drink to express its oils, adding a soft citrus essence to the taste.\nRecipe Variations\nThough blackberries are recommended and pair really well with Irish whiskey, feel free to use raspberries.\nThis recipe works just as well with other styles of whiskey. Try it with a smooth blended Canadian whisky or your favorite bourbon.\nSeltzer is unflavored sparkling water, and club soda will create a nearly identical drink. If you want to add a little sweetness and extra flavor, pour a lemon-lime soda or ginger ale instead.\nHow Strong Is a Blackberry Malt?\nSince an 80-proof whiskey is this cocktail's only liquor, it's a very mild drink.

Place it in the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.\nIf the tea has already been sweetened, there's no need to add extra honey unless you want it a little sweeter.\nRecipe Variations\nInstead of honey, sweeten your tea with a liqueur. A honey liqueur such as B?renj?ger is ideal, though you can add extra flavor with Benedictine, which also has a honey base. You can even add a twist by sweetening the martini with amaretto or a fruit liqueur; apricot would be fun.\nIf you're using simple syrup, it's easy to add more flavor to that ingredient as well. Consider a lavender or rosemary simple syrup to give your tea tini a floral touch, strawberry or raspberry for a fruity spin, or vanilla syrup for a nice richness.\nThe vodka doesn't have to be unflavored, either. Play around with flavored vodkas, pairing different fruits with a variety of teas. Citrus vodka is a good all-around choice that works with almost anything, though you can create some interesting flavors with berry, melon, peach, and vanilla infusions as well.\nAnother option for adding flavor is to begin with a fruity sweet tea that's already brewed and ready to drink. You will likely have to reduce or skip the lemon and honey completely.\nHow Strong Is a Tea Tini?\nIn the world of martinis, the tea tini is a relatively gentle cocktail. When made with 80-proof vodka and no extra liqueurs, its alcohol content averages out to 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

Cut peaches end to end on both sides, then twist halves in opposite directions to separate flesh; remove pits and set them aside for later use.\nThinly slice peaches.\nPut peaches, peach pits, lemon zest, and orange zest in a clean 2-quart glass canning jar.\nAdd the cooled sugar syrup, vodka, brandy, and food coloring.\nSeal jar with an airtight lid. Turn jar top to bottom in one full revolution to gently mix the contents.\nStore bottle in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks.\nAfter 2 weeks, strain out solids with a fine-mesh sieve.\nPour peach liqueur into a clean jar, seal it, and let it stand another 2 to 3 weeks in a cool, dark place.\nStrain the peach liqueur a final time through a double layer of cheesecloth or another kind of filter while transferring it to a decanter or decorative bottle.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nTaste your infusion a couple of times as it ages. You may be happy with a more subtle flavor and want to strain it ahead of the recommended 2 weeks. \nThe brandy adds another layer of flavor, but you can eliminate it and just use an extra cup of vodka if you prefer.\nOxidation from the bit of air in the bottle is what causes the liqueur to lose flavor, and you may even see some separation of the ingredients. Once that happens, it's best to discard the remainder and make another batch.\nHow to Use\nThis peach liqueur is perfect for fuzzy navels and peach margaritas. You can also add a splash to a gin and tonic, use it to make a Bellini, and give plain ice tea a peachy kick. Or turn the schnapps into a glaze for meat, poultry, or fish.\nRecipe Variations\nNeutral flavored vodka works especially well as the base for an infusion, but feel free to experiment with other spirits, such as gin, rum, or tequila. Generally, the lighter colored, least flavored versions provide the most dependable results.\nPlay with the flavors by adding complementary herbs or spices. Star anise, thyme, jalape?o, and mint all make good choices with peaches.\nUtah Seasonal Fruits & Vegetables""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/peach-liqueur-recipe-1807072

If you put the wine in first and then added the liqueur, you\'ll need to stir the drink to mix them together.\nThe cool temperature of the wine should keep this cocktail cold, but if it is too warm for your taste, you can pour it over a large ice cube; the low alcohol content of the drink will prevent the ice from watering down the cocktail.\nHow Did Kir Get Its Name?\nThe combination of dry white wine and cr?me de cassis became popular in French caf?s in the middle of the 19th century. After World War II, it was further popularized by Felix Kir, the then-mayor of Dijon in Burgundy, France, who served the drink often to promote his region\'s fine products (wine and cr?me de cassis). The name kir has been associated with the drink ever since and has become generic enough that Webster\'s Dictionary lists it in lower case.\nRecipe Variations\nKir Royale: Whenever you see ""royale"" in a cocktail name, it typically indicates that Champagne is an ingredient. Therefore, it\'s easy to remember that the kir royale substitutes Champagne for the white wine, serving the drink in a Champagne flute.\nCardinal Cocktail: This drink also features cr?me de cassis and simply substitutes red wine for the white.\nKir Imperial: Chambord or another raspberry liqueur replace the cr?me de cassis and Champagne is poured.\nKir Breton: Substitute Breton apple cider for the wine. Likewise, the kir Normand prefers cider from Normandy, France. Any apple cider will do just fine, though.\nKir Mocktail: You can also easily transform the kir into a nonalcoholic drink. Use grenadine instead of cassis, and cider, sparkling cider, or sparkling water in place of the wine.\nHow Strong Is a Kir Cocktail?\nCr?me de cassis is a low-proof liqueur that\'s typically bottled at 15 percent ABV. That\'s not much stronger than the average wine, so the kir is a light cocktail. On average, it mixes up to 12 percent ABV (24 proof). The variations fall into this range as well.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/kir-and-kir-royale-recipe-759312

Use a muddler or a wooden spoon to muddle, or crush, the cucumber slices a bit to bring out more of their flavor.\nPour in the vodka and the dry vermouth.\nSwirl just a bit to combine, then add the ice.\nPut the top on the cocktail shaker and shake vigorously for at least 30 seconds. (It\'s important that you shake for this length of time.) This not only mixes the ingredients but also melts some of the ice into the cocktail to soften its edges and blend the flavors.\nStrain the mixture into a martini glass.\nGarnish with thin slices of fresh cucumber and serve.\nTips\nCommon garden cucumbers or hothouse cucumbers are perfectly fine in this cocktail, but if you have another type of cucumber on hand, this is a great place to use them and appreciate their slightly different flavors. Lemon cucumbers, in particular, are a fun choice. \nIf you don\'t have a cocktail shaker, you can use a jar with a screw-top lid.\nLike all martinis, these pack a punch. The first one may go down easy, but watch out for the second one: It will make a third seem like a good idea, which it is most definitely not.\nVariations\nAdd a grind or two of freshly ground black pepper; it adds a lovely bit of heat to the cool cucumber, as well as a floral note to the final cocktail.\nFor a nice, herbal touch, include a few fresh green herbs in the shaker. Consider mint, thyme, or basil; chervil is an unexpected twist, and dill, if used sparingly, is tasty, too.\nCitrus and cucumber go very well together; add a twist of lemon or lime along with the thin cucumber slices.\nHow Strong is the Cucumber Martini?\nAny type of vodka martini is not considered a strong drink. With an 80-proof vodka and a typical dry vermouth, this one mixes up to about 28 percent ABV (56 proof). That means two martinis are stronger than a straight shot of vodka, so take it slow and think before mixing up the next one.\nIs a vodka martini really a martini?\nThe original martini recipe includes gin, not vodka, and martini purists will state that if this cocktail is made with vodka it is not a true martini. You may see the drink labeled as ""vodka martini"" when it\'s made with this liquor. Vodka offers a smoother taste while gin brings botanical flavor and complexity to the martini.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/cucumber-martinis-3967957

Feel free to adjust the proportions of any ingredient to suit your taste.\nThough you may be tempted to pour and stir this drink in the glass, shaking really does make a better cocktail. The agitation and dilution will soften the heaviness of the cream and give the drink a frothy lightness that\'s much more enjoyable.\nDeciding between milk and cream will produce a slightly different drink. Milk will create a lighter drink than cream. However, it\'s best not to use milk lighter than 1 percent because of the dilution from shaking; you will lose some of the richness, and the drink will seem watered down.\nThere are a number of cream options as well. Heavy whipping cream is almost too thick. For a nice balance between the two extremes, half-and-half is a perfect option and a great cream for most cocktails.\nAlternatively, nondairy milk choices (soy, almond, oat, etc.) should make an excellent toasted almond, albeit thinner. Using almond milk would be a natural choice because it will complement the amaretto.\nRecipe Variations\nThe roasted toasted almond (or burnt almond) is ""roasted"" by adding vodka to the mix. To make this drink, build 1 ounce each of vodka, coffee liqueur, and amaretto in an old-fashioned glass filled with ice. Top with milk or cream. Shake by placing a mixing tin over the glass and give it one or two good shakes.\nA flavored vodka such as espresso is a perfect choice and adds an extra coffee kick to the drink. It\'s also easy to make your own coffee-infused vodka?simply follow the steps in this coffee bourbon recipe. Other good options include chocolate and amaretto or any of the whipped cream or cake-flavored vodkas.\nHow Strong Is This Drink?\nThe roasted recipe is slightly stronger than the toasted almond, though both are relatively tame in the cocktail world. Using a 42-proof amaretto and 40-proof coffee liqueur, the alcohol content of the toasted almond averages out to 14 percent ABV (28 proof). Adding half a shot of 80-proof vodka creates a roasted toasted almond of about 18 percent ABV (36 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTip\nDip apple slices in lemon juice immediately after cutting them to prevent them from turning yellow.\nThe Irish Whiskey\nMichael Collins is the suggested Irish whiskey for this cocktail, though production issues in recent years have made it more difficult to find. It's likely that you will need to find a substitute. Almost any Irish whiskey will work perfectly, but Bushmills, Jameson and Kilbeggan would all be excellent options.\nThe Apple Schnapps\nThe sour apple schnapps gives this cocktail its beautiful green color and there are a number of options available. While DeKuyper Apple Pucker may be the first brand that comes to mind, try some of the premium brands like Bols, Deauville and Gabriel Boudier. Any of these would be a considerable upgrade and will create a better balance of flavor in the final drink.\nThe Cranberry Juice\nWhite cranberry juice is essential for allowing the schnapps to control the drink's color and it has other benefits as well. This clear-colored cranberry juice is not as sweet as the more popular red juice, which is important considering the very sweet taste of apple schnapps. This can be a difficult juice to find in the market, but a good grocer should have at least one option.\nHow Strong Is the Green Dublin Apple Cocktail?\nThe strength of this cocktail is going to depend on your choice of liquors. To give you a general idea, let's assume that your Irish whiskey is 80 proof and the apple schnapps 34 proof. In this case, the finished cocktail would be just around 17 percent alcohol by volume (34 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou may find that you prefer St. Germain Liqueur over an elderflower syrup for the simple fact that it's easy to find. Yet, the syrup can be homemade or purchased at the store; both Darbo and Monin make elderflower syrups that are very good in this drink. Which you choose may just be a matter of what you have on hand.\nWake up your mint to make it even more flavorful by slapping the leaves in your palms before muddling.\nSince the ginger beer is a short pour in this cocktail, think about using one that has a robust flavor to really give the drink a kick. Bundaberg, Q Ginger Beer, and Reed's are all excellent options.\nAny cucumber will do in the drink, but you may want to seek out English cucumbers specifically. This variety is sweeter and less bitter than the average slicer cucumber. Plus, the seeds are so small that they typically don't get in the way of drinking if they make it through the strainer. With larger cucumber seeds, you may want to remove any floaters.\nRecipe Variations\nOne way to give this cocktail a slightly new flavor is to pour a flavored vodka. Some nice options include citrus, melon, peach, pear, pomegranate, and even vanilla.\nYou can also make your own infused vodka flavored with cucumbers or a tropical fruit like mango or papaya, all of which are difficult (if not impossible) to find from commercial vodkas.\nRather than mint, try using borage in this recipe. It's a fun herb for cocktails and the flowers and young leaves have a flavor reminiscent of cucumber, so it's a perfect fit for the pot of gold.\nHow Strong Is a Pot of Gold?\nThe pot of gold is similar to most martini-style cocktails in that it's a relatively potent drink. When made with an 80-proof vodka and St. Germain, its alcohol content comes in around 22 percent ABV (44 proof).

They're about the size of a navel orange and should yield 2 to 3 ounces, so one fruit should be enough for a few margaritas.\nMarkets should have the fruit from December through April.\nBottled or concentrated blood orange juice can be found year round and that is the next best option. It's not common, so you will have to look a little harder. You might have luck at natural food grocers, specialty markets, or in the organic or health food section of larger supermarkets.\nIf you find the juice, check the expiration date and stock up while you can. In the past, some great companies have given up on this juice because it doesn't have high demand. Also, you can expect to pay more for blood orange juice than your typical orange juice, but it is worth it.\nBlood Orange Juice Alternatives\nIf you cannot find fresh blood oranges or the juice, there are alternatives. You will need to make some adjustments in the recipe to find a good balance of flavor. And yet, sampling your bloody margarita experiments is not a bad job to have! Enjoy the experience and you'll find a mix that works really well.\nStirrings Blood Orange Martini Mixer: Blood orange juice and key lime juice concentrates are mixed with cane sugar to make a decent alternative to blood orange juice. It's available as a 750ml bottle (the same size as the average liquor bottle) so it will last quite a while and is one of the more affordable options.\nMonin Blood Orange Syrup and Puree: One of the best-known syrup producers, Monin offers both a blood orange syrup and a fruit puree. Either would be a good substitute, though you will need to make adjustments from the recipe because both are thicker than a juice. Start with about 3/4 ounce, shake the margarita, and add more if needed.\nBlood Orange Puree: Most often found at specialty grocers or those concentrating on gourmet food, it is possible to find a blood orange puree. Again, you'll need to make adjustments to the recipe to suit your taste. It is also possible to add water to a puree to create a juice using your blender. Depending on the puree, you may want to strain out any pulp.\nHow Strong Is a Bloody Margarita?\nJust like the original margarita, the blood orange margarita is a pretty strong drink. On average, you can expect its alcohol content to fall in the 21 percent ABV (42 proof), or about half the strength of a straight tequila shot.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bloody-margarita-recipe-760801

Monin offers a violet syrup as well, though that will be much sweeter.\nThe aviation cocktail is definitely a place to show off your best gin. Dry gins with a strong juniper profile are customarily used, though nearly any gin will work quite nicely. It\'s also a good idea to try it with Aviation Gin. Explore your options to find your personal preference, but always keep quality in mind.\nIf you choose to skip the signature cr?me de violette, be careful about the cocktail\'s balance. Without this seemingly insignificant ingredient, the aviation can quickly become too sour.\nRecipe Variation\nTry adding 1/8 ounce of 1:1 simple syrup to this recipe to really smooth out the flavor profile. It\'s not necessary, but you may find that you enjoy the cocktail more with it.\nWho Invented the Aviation Cocktail?\nIt\'s not known exactly who invented the aviation cocktail. According to David Wondrich\'s ""Imbibe!,"" it was first printed in a 1916 book by Hugo Ensslin called ""Recipes for Mixed Drinks."" It is difficult to gauge how popular the cocktail was at the time, and because the key liqueur was likely just as rare as it is today, it\'s assumed that this was a specialty drink served at only the most elite bars.\nSometime in the 1930s, cr?me de violette was dropped from the aviation, and maraschino took over the drink. This can be noted in Harry Craddock\'s popular ""The Savoy Cocktail Book,"" which has been an influence on bartending guides since its first publication in 1930.\nFew cocktails beyond the aviation called for cr?me de violette, and by the 1960s, it had disappeared from the U.S. market. This sent the cocktail even further into obscurity until a recent cocktail renaissance and the rerelease of the floral liqueur.\nToday you will find the aviation on lists of classic cocktails that should be experienced. Even so, don\'t expect to order it at every bar. Despite being available again, cr?me de violette is not part of the average bar\'s inventory, though there are some that are trying to revive the aviation and will create a fantastic version for you to taste.\nHow Strong Is an Aviation Cocktail?\nCr?me de violette is typically bottled between 30 and 40 proof, which is about the same as most maraschino liqueurs. Add to that an 80-proof gin, and you have a pretty strong cocktail. As lovely as it tastes, the aviation\'s alcohol content is a rather potent 27 percent ABV (54 proof).

In fact, the daiquiri is a perfect use for bananas that are a little too ripe to eat but not quite ready to be used in banana bread.\nFor a more even consistency, briefly blend the banana and ice before adding the liquid ingredients.\nOne cup of ice is about five or six average-sized ice cubes.\nIf the banana daiquiri's a little too thin, add a couple of ice cubes and blend again. Too thick? Add an extra splash of a liquid ingredient.\nWhat Rum Is Best in a Banana Daiquiri?\nWhite rum is typically used in a banana daiquiri, and quality rum will produce a better-tasting cocktail. Pour aged, dark, or spiced rum instead for a little more flavor. Coconut rum is a popular option for this drink, and it's a great use for banana rum, too.\nRecipe Variations\nTurn this into a frozen banana margarita by switching from rum to tequila.\nMake it more of a creamy smoothie: Cut the ice in half and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or blend it up with chocolate or strawberry ice cream.\nAnother way to make the mix creamier is to add 1 ounce of milk, coconut milk, or a cream liqueur.\nDrizzle chocolate, caramel, or strawberry syrup on top for a sweet garnish.\nAdd more fresh fruits, such as blueberries, mango, papaya, pineapple, raspberries, or strawberries.\nGive it a slightly darker profile by adding 1/2 to 3/4 ounce of amaretto or another nut-flavored liqueur like Frangelico.

You can also keep your shot glasses in the freezer so they're frosty as well.\nIf you like, switch from a regular vodka to a flavored one. Almost any of the fruit-flavored vodkas will go great with the three fruits, so choose your favorite. Citrus, berry, or melon vodkas would be great places to start. To retain the stoplight colors, just make sure the vodka is clear because some flavored vodkas are not.\nThe fruit ingredients suggested are not your only options, they just happen to be standard in most bars and taste really good together. You can use alternatives, such as another red juice or grenadine rather than cranberry juice, or pineapple juice instead of orange.\nOn the other hand, a green melon liqueur (like Midori) may be your best option for the green shot. However, you can go with one of those electric green juice drinks kids love or a green sports drink if you have them on hand and want to save money.\nHow Strong Is the Stoplight Shooter?\nLet's be honest, the stoplight is nothing more than a series of straight vodka shots that you're going to drink in a minute or less. The fruit is just a flavor and color additive, so while it may look pretty, this is not a shooter for the faint of heart.\n\nRather than do the math, let's just assume that these shots are the bottling proof of your vodka, which is typically 40 percent alcohol by volume or 80 proof.

A clear vodka will not affect the cocktail's flavor much, so this will taste almost exactly like a fuzzy navel. That's great, but you can add a nice punch of flavor by choosing a flavored vodka instead. There are some interesting flavor combinations to be found if you pour an infused vodka; consider complementary fruit flavors such as apple, pear, or pomegranate. A whipped cream or cake vodka will give the drink a cream soda type of taste, which is also fun.\nUse fresh orange juice. The majority of the hairy navel is orange juice so it only makes sense to use fresh-squeezed juice. The average orange yields about 1/4 cup of juice, which is about 8 ounces. That should be more than enough to fill your highball glass. Depending on the size of your glass, how much ice you use, and the amount of liquor you pour, it may even be good for two drinks.\nAdd soda or lemonade. Mixed drinks like the hairy navel can use a little kick at times. It's easy to make it just a little more refreshing by adding soda or lemonade. Any of the clear sodas will bring a nice sparkle to the hairy navel; choose a club soda, ginger ale, or lemon-lime soda. When doing so, cut the juice a little. As an alternative, you might find that a hot summer afternoon calls for mixing in some fresh lemonade.\nTurn the Hairy Navel Into a Punch\nTo transform the recipe into a punch, use the same ratio for the liquors and then fill the punch bowl or pitcher with orange juice. Adding soda is a great option here; start out with equal parts juice and soda and adjust it to taste. Next, add some slices of citrus fruit and a good amount of ice, and you're ready to serve. You can also make the punch long before the party; just add the soda right before serving.\nHow Strong Is the Hairy Navel?\nEven though there's vodka in it, the hairy navel is still a pretty tame drink. With a 48-proof schnapps like Peachtree, an 80-proof vodka, and about 4 ounces of juice, we estimate that this mixed drink is only about 9 percent ABV (18 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/hairy-navel-cocktail-recipe-761071

Stir well for at least 30 seconds.\nStrain into a collins glass filled with fresh ice cubes.\nGarnish with a cherry and pineapple wedge. Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nShake this cocktail to create a frothier drink. Just be sure to shake it until the outside of your cocktail shaker gets frosty and almost too cold to handle.\nFor the frozen version, pour the ingredients into a blender with 1 cup of cracked ice and blend until smooth. It's enough for one tall drink or two shorter drinks if you'd like to share it with a friend.\nWant a slightly lighter drink? Switch to coconut milk or coconut cream as both are not as thick as the cream of coconut (sometimes labeled creme de coconut).\nSince taste varies per person, if this cocktail is too sweet for you, add 1/2 ounce of lemon juice to help balance that out.\nBlue Hawaiian vs. Blue Hawaii\nIt is easy to confuse the blue Hawaiian with the blue Hawaii cocktail. While both are blue due to the cura?ao liqueur, the blue Hawaii uses sour mix instead of creme de coconut. As a rule of thumb, if you see a coconut ingredient (including coconut rum) suggested in a recipe, you are making a blue Hawaiian cocktail.\nBartender Harry Yee created the blue Hawaii at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in 1957. He was asked to develop a cura?ao drink by a sales representative for Bols, a Dutch distiller known for liqueurs as well as genever. The tropical drink soon made its way to other tropical-themed bars, including the famous Trader Vic's. It's highly likely that the blue Hawaiian was an adaptation of the original drink.\nIf you want to make a blue Hawaii, it's incredibly simple: Split the Hawaiian's rum with an equal part of vodka (3/4 ounce each), then pour 1/2 ounce blue cura?ao, 3 ounces pineapple juice, and 1 ounce sour mix. Shake and strain over fresh ice, using a pineapple-cherry garnish.\nHow Strong Is a Blue Hawaiian?\nAssuming that you pour an 80-proof rum, the blue Hawaiian is not too boozy. It mixes up to about 15 percent ABV (30 proof), so it's like having a glass of strong wine. If you toss it in the blender with ice, it's an even softer drink, right around 6 percent ABV (12 proof).\nWhy Is My Blue Hawaiian Green?\nThe hue of your cocktail will depend on the ratio of the ingredients and how colorful your blue cura?ao is. When properly mixed, you should have a nice aquamarine blue color. If your cura?ao isn't making the mixture blue enough, add a drop or two of blue food coloring to achieve the signature color.\nDoes Blue Cura?ao Contain Alcohol?\nBlue cura?ao is a citrus-flavored liqueur and contains between 15 and 40 percent alcohol.\nCocktail Party Drink Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blue-hawaiian-recipe-759284

While it is a nice choice, think about exploring your options because there are some great ones available. Brinley Coconut is a favorite for many rum fans and Cruzan, Caruba, and Don Q are good ones to try as well.\nThe list of banana liqueurs available is short because it is not one of the most common flavors for drinks. Look for 99 Bananas Schnapps or Bols Creme de Banana as these are two of the best options.\nYou will find quite a few dark rum options available in any liquor store.

To make it, pour 1 1/2 ounces each raspberry liqueur and Crown Royal Whisky, then add 3 ounces of cranberry juice and stir. Any raspberry liqueur will work: Chambord and DeKuyper Razzmatazz are two popular options. \nThe raspberry rock lobster can also be made into a party shooter. There are a couple of unique shots floating around that also go by this name.\nOne is very similar to the highball and mixes equal parts Southern Comfort, amaretto, and cranberry juice. Shake and strain it into a shot glass.\nThe other is completely different than any other rock lobster. This one asks you to layer in equal proportions Irish cream, amaretto, and white cr?me de cacao. Make sure to float them in that order or the layers won\'t work.\nHow Strong Is a Rock Lobster?\nAs with all blended cocktails, the ice used into the rock lobster knocks the alcohol content down significantly. On average, you can expect this drink to weigh in somewhere around 5 percent ABV (10 proof), so it\'s similar to drinking a beer, only much fruitier.\nEspresso Martini Granita Recipe']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rock-lobster-cocktail-recipe-759792

Substitute two 15.5-ounce cans of crushed or sliced pineapple for the whole fresh pineapple.\nHow to Cut a Pineapple\nWith containers of diced pineapple available in the produce section of the supermarket, you may think it isn't worth buying a whole pineapple and cutting it up yourself. If you compare price tags, however, you might change your mind?pineapple chunks can cost around three times more than a whole pineapple. Once you know how to cut the fruit properly and easily, buying cut-up fruit could be a thing of the past. \nFirst, make sure you have a large cutting board and a sharp knife. Having the compost bin nearby doesn't hurt either.\nLay the pineapple on its side and cut off the top and the bottom and discard.\nNow stand up the pineapple on one of the flat ends. Using the tip of the knife, begin slicing off the outside of the pineapple in strips, trying not to cut too much of the yellow flesh.

According to Raffles, Ngiam Tom Boon\'s intent was clear: to produce a cocktail that looked like juice and had a rosy color that would appeal to women. It was, as the hotel notes, ""a socially acceptable punch for the ladies."" Beyond gin, pineapple juice is the primary ingredient in the Raffles version. It also includes grenadine, lime juice, B?n?dictine, Cointreau, and?for the ""pretty pink hue""?cherry brandy. (They failed to mention grenadine\'s contribution to the color.)\nAn Earlier Singapore Sling\nRaffles has the most famous claim to the Singapore sling. However, cocktail historian David Wondrich tells an entirely different story in his book, ""Imbibe!"" An adaptation of the gin sling, it may have been around since 1897 or so and was a popular hangover cure and a general cure-all for anything that might ail you.\nWondrich dug up a recipe from the Singapore Cricket Club. This version pours 1 ounce each of cherry brandy, gin, B?n?dictine, and lime juice. Wondrich recommends stirring it with ice, then finishing it off with 1 to 2 ounces of sparkling water and a dash of Angostura Bitters. For the gin, a traditional London dry or Old Tom is a nice choice, and the suggested garnish is a lime twist.\nThat recipe is missing the pineapple juice. It\'s possible that it was the key ingredient Ngiam used to ""improve"" a popular drink found throughout Singapore at the time.\nPopular Singapore Sling Variations\nWondrich notes that a few recipes from the 1930s used either claret or sloe gin to give the sling its signature color. With either, he recommends cutting back on the lime and B?n?dictine, then adding more gin.\nHarry Craddock\'s ""The Savoy Cocktail Book"" (1930) includes the simplest Singapore sling: Dry gin, cherry brandy, lemon juice, and soda.\nTwo popular versions are found in Gary ""Gaz"" Regan\'s ""The Joy of Mixology."" The Singapore Sling No. 2 recipe uses 2 ounces each of pineapple juice and Beefeater Gin, 1/2 ounce each of Cherry Heering and triple sec, 1/4 ounce B?n?dictine, and 3/4 ounce of lime juice. It\'s topped with Angostura Bitters and club soda. This recipe was apparently found on a coaster from Raffles and lacked measurements, so bartenders had to wing it to come up with these recommendations.\nRegan\'s Singapore Sling No. 1 recipe is completely different and skips the pineapple. Instead, it uses 2 ounces of gin, 1/2 ounce each of B?n?dictine and kirsch, 3/4 ounce of lemon juice, and both orange and aromatic bitters. As with most slings, it is topped with club soda.\nWhich Sling Recipe Is for You?\nThese versions do not even begin to reflect the many Singapore slings you can find. There are too many to count.\nMany drinkers make matters worse by trying to replicate the look of the sling they were served at Raffles and inundate it with too much red (typically grenadine). This can make the drink too sweet. Any cocktail\'s appearance is not as important as the taste, and the color may be off for any number of reasons. For instance, you may be using the colorless kirsch while the bar uses Cherry Heering or a cherry brandy with a similar deep red color. \nThe goal is to find a Singapore sling that you enjoy. Chasing the original recipe or going for the ""right color"" is not a productive approach. Some recipes have a drier profile, while others are sweeter, and you can always make your own adjustments. Why not? Everyone else did.\nThe good news is that, for the most part, Singapore sling recipes agree on similar ingredients. That means you can save a little money and stock your bar with the essentials while playing around with these recipes until you find your ideal formula. Write it down so you can duplicate it later, then sit back and enjoy this iconic cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Singapore Sling?\nThe Singapore sling is a lovely fruit punch that\'s relatively easy on the alcohol. Despite all the variables, it typically mixes up to about 15 percent ABV (30 proof), which is average for highball drinks.\nGin Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/singapore-sling-recipe-760602

It offers just enough tequila flavor and is often a little more affordable than its aged counterparts.\nThen again, there's something to be said for adding a little barrel-aging flavor to this drink. Give the Irish cactus a try with a good reposado tequila and compare the difference. You might be pleasantly surprised.\nBaileys is the best-known Irish cream, but there are other brands available. This recipe is a good one to try any new-to-you bottles. Try Carolan's, Kerrygold, Molly's, O'Darby, or St. Brendan's to see how they stack up.\nTo reduce dilution, consider serving this (and any creamy cocktail) over large pieces of ice rather than cubes. Two-inch cubes and ice balls will melt slower so you don't have to suffer through a watered-down drink.\nRecipe Variations\nServe this cocktail up in a cocktail glass for a fancier presentation. Stir it in a cocktail shaker, then strain it. Since there's no ice in the glass, you'll find it best when the glass is well-chilled.\nAdding 1/2 ounce of coffee liqueur is a nice addition to this drink?it's sort of a creamy sombrero. Kahlua is a common choice in that flavor, though for the Irish cactus you might want to go with the tequila-based Patron XO Cafe.\nOddly enough, the Irish cactus is a nice mix, but another tequila-Irish cream drink is not such a hit. The Apocalypse Now shooter combines the two, but it also mixes the tequila with dry vermouth before Irish cream is layered on top. It just goes to show that sometimes the simpler drinks are best.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Cactus?\nThe Irish cactus may be soothing and delicious, but it also has an alcohol kick. When made with the average liquors, it mixes up to 23 percent ABV (46 proof). That's right in line with most fruity martinis as well as the shaken margarita.\n10 Best Irish Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/irish-cactus-cocktail-recipe-759702

Rather than worrying about measurements, visually divide your glass into thirds and pour the ingredients accordingly.\nFloat the Irish cream liqueur on top of the cr?me de menthe by pouring it slowly over the back of a bar spoon.\nFloat the Grand Marnier on top of the Irish cream liqueur, again using the back of a bar spoon.\nDo not stir. Serve as is, making sure not to jostle the drink too much so the colors don\'t bleed into each other. Enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitching any of the three ingredients can mess with the layers because each has its own specific gravity, which is based on its sugar and alcohol content. You need to pour them from heaviest to lightest so they don\'t resemble a lava lamp when you\'re finished (although that can be fun too).\nIf you want to swap ingredients, you\'ll need to experiment to see what works. For instance, switching from Grand Marnier to orange cura?ao will generally not work. Cura?ao tends to have more sugar and is lower proof, so it won\'t float on Irish cream. This can vary from one brand to another.\nRather than cr?me de menthe, you can try DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker.\nAs demonstrated in the Irish frog, Irish cream will float on top of Midori, so that\'s another green option.\nYou might have luck if you switch the colors up (it will not be the ""Irish flag"" replica, which goes in the order of green, white, and orange). You could, for example, pour orange cura?ao, then Irish cream, and finish up with Green Chartreuse (reversing the flag effect). Or, pour Irish cream, then Grand Marnier, then Green Chartreuse.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Flag?\nMade entirely of liquor, don\'t expect this to be a light shot. In fact, Grand Marnier is bottled at a full 80 proof, so it\'s just as strong as the average whiskey or tequila. Since there\'s also no dilution in the Irish flag to factor in, its alcohol content is 28 percent ABV (56 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variation\nJust like the pi?a colada, this drink can be shaken and produce a very nice drink. Simply add the ingredients to a cocktail shaker, switching to banana liqueur, shake vigorously, then strain out the ice.\nTips\nDon't worry too much about adding just 1/3 of a banana or 1/2 ounce of Irish cream. Using a whole banana and a full shot (1 ounce to 1 1/2 ounces) of Baileys can only make the drink better.\nAs written, the recipe creates about a 10-ounce drink, so you'll need a large glass. You can also split it into two glasses and share (or keep the excess for yourself in the freezer).\nThe toasted coconut used for the garnish is easy to make. Spread coconut flakes onto a baking sheet and toast in a 350 F oven for about 15 minutes, or until golden brown. You do want to stir the flakes every few minutes so they don't burn. Let the flakes cool completely before using.\nThere are two types of coconut milk and which you choose will depend on how thick you'd like the drink. Canned coconut milk is thick, rich, and creamy. It tends to separate in the can so you can either mix it back up or enjoy either the thick top or thin bottom layer (or a little of both). The other option is the coconut milk that's used as a dairy alternative (typically sold in cartons). This will produce a thinner cocktail that's a bit more of a slushy rather than a smoothie, though it will still be creamy.\nCream of coconut is used often in pi?a coladas and is an excellent alternative to the milk.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Encounter?\nThe Irish encounter falls in line with other blended cocktails in that its a low-proof drink. In fact, it's not much stronger than beer, weighing in at just 7 percent ABV (14 proof).\n10 Best Irish Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/irish-encounter-recipe-760486

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk for foodborne illness.\nTips\nDark rum and ruby port are essential foundations for the Chicago Fizz. These choices give the drink its character and rich flavor and lighter versions of either will make a rather dull drink in comparison.\nIf you prefer, you may skip the egg white, though you will find it loses some of its silky appeal. The egg white does not affect the flavor of the drink, instead gives it a rich texture that is very alluring. Before adding soda, the strained drink will have a creamy texture and a foam will form on the top to create a beautiful effect.\nWhen mixing any drink that uses either egg or raw sugar, put extra emphasis on the shaking. The key to these drinks is to ensure that the ingredients are thoroughly mixed and the egg is properly broken down and integrated with the rest of the ingredients. Thirty seconds is a minimum and I like to remind myself to ""shake it \'til it hurts."" Egg drinks should be a good workout for the arms.\nWhile bottled club soda or seltzer water will do, it as (as with any fizz) best with soda from a good, old-fashioned soda siphon.\nPro tip: When working with those small glass bottles of soda, break the seal on the cap ever so slightly and wait a few seconds for the initial release of gas before removing the cap entirely. By doing this, you will prevent the soda from fizzing over the sides and creating a mess.\nHow Strong Is the Chicago Fizz?\nThe Chicago Fizz can very in its alcohol content because there are many factors involved in making it.\n\nTo get a general idea of its strength, let\'s assume that we make it with egg, an 80 proof rum, 40 proof port, and top it with about 1 ounce of soda.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSuperfine (or caster) sugar is a better choice for cocktails because the finer crystals dissolve more easily. This is particularly useful in a cocktail like a caipirinha, which doesn't have a lot of liquid or hard-core mixing.\nDon't worry about hunting down a specialty sugar. It's very easy to transform ordinary sugar into superfine sugar with a food processor or blender.\nUse the recommended range of sugar to customize the cocktail's sweetness to your taste and the cacha?a you're pouring. Some cacha?as are sweeter than others, and quite a few are aged, so there are times when less sugar creates a better drink.\nThough not traditional, simple syrup is a good substitute for superfine sugar; use about 3/4 ounce of syrup. Agave nectar and honey syrup can also act as the sweetener.\nRecipe Variations\nBuild on the caipirinha by adding extra flavor or taking its flavor into a different style of drink. Using these variations as an inspiration, see what new fruits, herbs, and other ingredients are at the produce market, and don't be afraid to accent it with a liqueur for extra flavor.\nThe caipirini is a shaken version that serves the drink martini-style.\nTransform the lime-cacha?a mix into a summer treat by making ice pops.\nToss a few berries into the glass for a raspberry caipirinha, or try a combination like blueberries with lemon and lime wedges.\nFor a spiced citrus twist, mix up a kumquat-ginger caipirinha.\nIn the homecoming caipirinha, autumn flavors abound with apple, cinnamon, and sage.\nA spiced pear caipirini is ideal for colder months with its mix of pear nectar, ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg.\nCan You Make a Caipirinha Without Cacha?a?\nWhen the caipirinha gained international fame, bartenders began to remake the cocktail. Not only were a variety of flavors added, but it also became common to swap the cacha?a out for another liquor. Using the same recipe, these variations are not true caipirinhas, though they have taken on similar names:\nCaipirila: tequila\nCaipirissima: white rum\nCaipiroska: vodka\nCaipisake: sake\nHow Strong Is the Caipirinha?\nMuch like other liquor-only muddled cocktails, there is not much in the caipirinha to dilute the liquor. Factoring in a little lime juice and a meager amount of dilution, its alcohol content falls around 30 percent ABV (60 proof). It's always going to be slightly lower than the cacha?a's bottling strength, so this is not a weak drink.\nWhen Was the Caipirinha Invented?\nAlthough it's ingrained in Brazilian culture, the history of the caipirinha is not clear. Some stories dated it to the 19th century, when it was enjoyed on sugarcane plantations. Another account says that it evolved from a medicinal tonic of cacha?a, green lemon, honey, and garlic used during the Spanish flu epidemic of the early 20th century.\nWhat's the Difference Between the Caipirinha and Mojito?\nThough they're constructed in similar ways and are equally refreshing, the caipirinha and mojito are distinctly different. The common ingredients are sugar and fresh lime, and both cocktails employ a muddler, but that's where the similarities end. The Cuban mojito uses mint and club soda and features rum, which lacks the funky herbaceous taste of cacha?a. While soda makes its way into some adaptations of the caipirinha, it is not a traditional ingredient.\n5 Best Cachacas for Mixing up a Fantastic Caipirinha""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/caipirinha-recipe-759290

There's no need to pour your good beer into this drink, so save the IPAs, stouts, and ales for drinking on their own.\n\nSpice it up: You also can dress up this drink's flavor in the same way you would a bloody mary. If you happen to have a bloody mary mix in the refrigerator, go ahead and use that. Everything you need is right there, and you'll get a very flavorful drink.\n\nShould you opt for the straight pour of tomato juice, don't skip the salt. It marries the two flavors together, which is why bartenders will often give you a salt shaker when you order a red beer. Just a pinch will do and be sure not to overdo it because it can quickly become too salty.\nVariations\nIf you like, add a dash of hot sauce, a grind of pepper, or a pinch of celery salt to the mix. Be sure to go slow, stir the drink, and give it a taste before adding anything else. After a red beer or two, you'll find the perfect combination for your personal taste.\nHow Strong Is the Red Beer?\nDepending on how you build it, the bloody mary often weighs in somewhere around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). It's a relatively light cocktail, which is why it's long been a morning favorite.\n\nEven though we're pouring more beer into the red eye, the absence of liquor makes this a considerably weaker drink. If you begin with a 5.0 percent ABV beer, the finished red eye will be brought down to a mere 4.2 percent ABV.\n15 Cocktails for Game Day""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/red-beer-for-brunch-759786

Your favorite ""well"" vodka will do just fine and there is a variety of great budget-friendly vodkas available today.\nHow Strong Is the Smith & Kearns?\nMixed drinks like this can be as light or strong as you want to make them. Pour more liquor and less soda for a stiff drink if you prefer, though it is difficult to make it very strong. The Smith & Kearns was designed to be a nice, casual drink. At an average alcohol content of 6 percent ABV (12 proof), it definitely fits the bill.

Shake well. Strain into the prepared glass with or without fresh ice. Garnish with a lime.\nTips\nChoosing quality liquors is essential to a superior margarita. Tequila is the main ingredient and a cheap, low-quality tequila will only bring the drink down. Pick up a medium- to high-end blanco or reposado tequila and a premium triple sec, such as Cointreau, for this cocktail.\nLikewise, you\'ll get a better margarita with fresh-squeezed lime juice. The average lime yields about 1 ounce of juice, which is about perfect for this recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer a tart margarita, pour equal amounts of triple sec and lime juice or try 1 ounce of lime juice and 1/2 ounce of triple sec.\nTo make it a little sweeter, add about 2 teaspoons of simple syrup or agave nectar.\nFor a simple twist, try a blue margarita. The recipe simply substitutes blue cura?ao for the triple sec to create a stunning drink with the same flavor.\nWhen you\'re ready to add flavor, there are many fruity margarita recipes to choose from. Apple, strawberry, and watermelon are favorites, though almost any fruit works and most can be either shaken or blended.\nYou can also enjoy the more uniquely flavored margaritas. Coconut, chocolate, and tamarind are just a few variations that are as fun to make as they are to drink.\nNot a fan of tequila? Pour a shot of vodka instead and you\'ll have a vodkarita (essentially the same as a kamikaze cocktail).\nA Mason Jar Margarita\nThe Spruce Eats / Claire Cohen \nIt has become popular to serve margaritas in a Mason jar with a ton of ice. The original margarita recipe was designed to be served as a short drink, with a volume of just 3 1/2 ounces. As with most classic cocktail recipes, it will barely fill many of today\'s larger margarita and cocktail glasses, much less a Mason jar.\nIf you want to make a Mason jar margarita, you need a recipe designed for the larger volume. This modern version makes a drink that\'s just over 6 ounces. With plenty of ice cubes and fresh fruit, it will fill the average Mason jar mug perfectly.\nTo make this margarita, shake 2 ounces tequila, 1 ounce triple sec, and 3 ounces fresh sour mix with ice. Strain it into an ice-filled Mason jar (rimmed, if you like) and add a few lime wedges.\nThis can also be mixed directly in your Mason jar. At first, cut back on the ice, shake or stir the drink, then fill it with fresh ice cubes.\nIf you\'re a fan of mixing drinks in Mason jars, Shane Carley\'s ""The Mason Jar Cocktail Companion"" is an excellent book. All of the recipes are measured in parts and many of the booze-heavy recipes have been adapted to the higher volume. Carley\'s Mason jar margarita, for instance, mixes 3 parts tequila, 2 parts orange liqueur, and 1 part lime juice.\nIs Triple Sec Required in a Margarita?\nTriple sec is one of the key ingredients in a margarita. It acts as the drink\'s sweetener and adds a hint of orange flavor. You can use another orange liqueur, such as cura?ao, and the Cadillac margarita uses the brandy-based Grand Marnier. Though definitely not an authentic margarita, some people prefer to skip the liqueur and use simple syrup with a squeeze of fresh orange juice instead (orange-flavored syrup is an alternative). With these changes, you will need to play with the proportions to create a well-balanced margarita.\nWhere Was the Margarita Invented?\nThere are a number of stories about where the margarita was created. It\'s difficult to say which (if any) is true. In the book ""Imbibe!,"" David Wondrich traces its roots to around the repeal of Prohibition. ""Margarita"" is the Spanish word for ""daisy"" and this drink (along with the original tequila sunrise) belongs to the daisy family of cocktails.\nDrinks like the brandy daisy were very popular in the late 1800s and made with any base spirit, including brandy, gin, rum, and whiskey. They follow a formula of spirit, sweetener, orange liqueur, lemon juice, and soda. When tequila started to reach American bars, the tequila daisy?made with tequila, orange liqueur, lime juice, and sometimes soda?appeared. It wasn\'t long before it became known as the margarita.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between a Daiquiri and a Margarita?\nThe daiquiri and margarita are two very popular classic cocktails that have a similar sweet-tart flavor profile. The original recipes for both use lime juice, though the daiquiri has a rum base and is typically sweetened with simple syrup rather than triple sec. Both cocktails can be made with a variety of fruits or tossed in the blender too.\nHow Strong Is a Margarita?\nUsing the original recipe and an 80-proof tequila along with Cointreau, the margarita is definitely not a low-proof cocktail. It shakes up to around 27 percent ABV (54 proof), or just over half the strength of a tequila shot. If you serve it on the rocks, it will dilute and relax a bit over time.\nMargarita Mocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/fresh-margarita-cocktail-recipe-759317

Garnish with the amaretto-soaked cherry. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou'll want to muddle this cocktail very well to incorporate all the herb, spice, and citrus flavors into the sugar and cider mix. Press and turn the ingredients for a good 30 seconds. Don't worry about appearances because you'll strain everything out of the drink anyway.\nSaffron will stain a wood muddler a yellowish color.

Simply follow the steps for homemade maraschino cherries and switch the liqueur to amaretto.\nRecipe Variations\nTrue saffron is a very expensive spice and it's not a staple in most pantries. You can either skip the red spice?sold whole as strings or powdered?or use a small pinch of turmeric instead. Turmeric is a saffron substitute used for the similar yellow color it produces. It doesn't have a big effect on this drink because of the bourbon and cider, but it does help.\nWild Turkey 101 is the recommended bourbon and it stands up to the myriad of flavors in this cocktail. Of course, you can use any bourbon you like, though lighter whiskies may get lost in the mix. You'll likely find it best to stick with a full-flavor, robust substitute that's also higher than 80 proof.\nHow Strong Is the Old-Fashioned?\nOld-fashioneds are served as short drinks that are typically less than 3 ounces because they are on the stronger side.

Garnish with a cherry and an orange or lemon slice. You can also pin the cherry to the citrus fruit using a cocktail pick and create a garnish known as a flag.\nTip\nTo serve, you can shake the gin, juice, and syrup instead of stirring, then strain it into a glass with fresh ice.\nRecipe Variations\nReplace the gin with whiskey to get a John Collins. Similarly, switch to the vodka Collins or the brandy Collins. A rum Collins uses white rum, but the Charlie Collins calls specifically for a Jamaican rum. You can also pour tequila for a tequila Collins.\nUse the recipe formula to create fascinating cocktails with any extra flavors you like. The American Collins, for example, adds Bing cherries and blueberries to the gin recipe, while the lavender Sapphire Collins uses a floral syrup.\nWhen you want something truly unique, try the rhubarb Collins with homemade rhubarb syrup.\nHow Strong Is a Tom Collins?\nAs with most soda highballs, the Tom Collins is a light drink. In fact, the majority of wines are stronger than this cocktail. On average, when made with an 80-proof gin, its alcohol content should be in the 9 percent ABV (18 proof) range. That's perfectly casual and the reason why this has long been a favorite recipe for happy hour.\nWhy Is It Called a Tom Collins?\nThe drink's name stems from the Tom Collins Hoax of 1874, whereby one person would tell another that someone with that name was speaking ill of him or her at a nearby bar or business, sending that person off to find such an individual and seek revenge. A clever bartender in New York decided to deliver a drink to someone looking for a so-called Tom Collins at his bar, and the name stuck.\nWhat Is a Tom Collins Glass?\nA collins glass is a tall, skinny glass that typically holds between 10 and 14 ounces. It's similar to a highball glass, and the two are sometimes used interchangeably for mixed drinks, especially bubbly drinks like the Tom Collins and highball.\nEssential Gin Cocktails You Must Try\nWatch Now: Two Simple Ways to Make Sour Mix""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tom-collins-recipe-759833

Pour the two rums and syrup into the glass.\nAdd 2 dashes each of aromatic and orange bitters.\nStir well and garnish with an orange peel. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThis cocktail is designed to showcase a sipping rum, so use mid-range or top-shelf brands that you enjoy on their own.\nThis old-fashioned recipe is designed for a rich (or 2:1) syrup: Use 2 parts sugar to 1 part water and either make it on the stovetop or shake the two ingredients in a jar or shaker until the sugar dissolves. The latter is ready for immediate use because it doesn't need to be cooled.\nFor the garnish, use a sharp pairing knife to cut a large piece (about 2 inches long) of orange peel. Try to avoid cutting into the bitter white pith.\nYou can squeeze the peel over the drink to express bits of orange oil into the mix. If you're careful (and haven't already had too much to drink), do this in front of a lighter or lit match; little sparks are produced when the oils hit the flame.\nRecipe Variations\nThe rum old-fashioned works well with a single aged or dark rum. In this case, pour a 2-ounce shot.\nTry the rum old-fashioned with orgeat syrup. Its floral, nutty flavor is an excellent pairing for rum.\nSome rum old-fashioned recipes add 1/4 ounce or so of allspice dram or falernum for extra flavor.\nWhat Is Demerara Syrup?\nDemerara syrup is a simple syrup made with demerara sugar. It's a large-grain type of raw cane sugar that's brown in color and richer in flavor than white sugar. Turbinado and other types of raw sugar are good substitutes, as is coconut (or palm) sugar.\nHow Strong Is a Rum Old-Fashioned\nNavy rum is often bottled around 57 percent ABV (114 proof), and dark rums may be a little stronger than the average 80-proof rum. With that in mind and the fact that it's tamed down by just a bit of syrup and ice dilution, the rum old-fashioned is always going to be a strong drink. This cocktail should weigh in around 33 percent ABV (66 proof), and that will vary based on the rums you choose.\nRum Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rum-old-fashioned-recipe-5096011

If you don't have, for instance, blackberry brandy, you can use the more common grenadine. Both have almost the same weight so the second layer will easily float on top.\nBlackberry Brandy vs. Grenadine. The first layer in your Jelly Bean shot gives you the greatest option in flavor. You will choose between blackberry or pomegranate (sorry, real grenadine is not cherry-flavored) and this will impact the taste of the drink. Either option is fine, yet as already pointed out, grenadine is easier to find. You can also choose a blackberry liqueur as many brandies available in this flavor today are sweetened and very liqueur-like anyway. The point is that in this instance you do want the sugar because it adds to the weight of the liqueur. The heavier this bottom layer, the easier it will be to float the second on top of it.\nAnisette vs. Sambuca. Both anise and sambuca are anise-flavored liqueurs and this is the layer that gives the Jelly Bean its black licorice-like flavor. Don't worry if you're not a fan of the individual taste because the shot's other ingredients do a fair job of combating that and it's actually quite nice. Anisette is a clear-colored liqueur while sambuca comes in a variety of colors. You might find bottles of sambuca in green, red, gold, or white (actually clear), and it's a fun way to add color to that middle layer.\nSouthern Comfort. Southern Comfort is a liqueur and not a whiskey, though it's almost as light as whiskey, which is why it's a perfect top layer for the Jelly Bean. Then again, you can always use whiskey instead if you really do not want to buy a bottle of SoCo. The fruity flavor of Southern Comfort does add to the Jelly Bean's taste. The apricot-peach taste acts as a sort of bridge between the sweeter bottom and the herbal middle. Because it hits your mouth first, it almost prepares your tongue for the anise that follows.\nHow Strong Is the Jelly Bean?\nJust to get an idea of the alcohol content in a Jelly Bean shooter, let's compare two options for building this drink. Of course, these are just estimates based on the average alcohol content for each liqueur and it will vary depending on the brands you choose.\nJelly Bean with Blackberry Brandy and Anisette: 28% ABV (56 proof)\nJelly Bean with Grenadine and Sambuca: 25% ABV (50 proof)\n\nAs you can see, there is very little difference between the two drinks. That is because, despite using a nonalcoholic grenadine, sambuca is often twice as strong as anisette. Also, neither drink is what we'd call 'light' because it is not shaken and therefore the alcohol is not diluted with water.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jelly-bean-shooter-759443

Use it as the base for homemade sodas, the sweetener for lemonade, or in any drink that calls for simple syrup, agave nectar, honey, or other liquid sweeteners.\nRecipe Variations\nInfuse the syrup with herbs, spices, or other botanicals. Add the flavoring ingredients while the syrup simmers and strain it out once cool (or before if it reaches your desired flavor). Cinnamon, lavender, mint, and vanilla are excellent options.\nFor a quick flavor boost, add about 1/4 teaspoon of a flavoring extract to the cooled syrup, and adjust to taste.\nUse this syrup as a base for a homemade sour mix by adding lemon and/or lime juices.\nCreate a sugar-free triple sec substitute by adding a tablespoon of orange juice and orange peels before simmering. Use this for margaritas, cosmopolitans, and any other cocktail that calls for orange liqueur.\nSimilarly, play with fruits, such as cherry, pomegranate, and raspberry, to replace flavored liqueurs and syrups. Use fresh fruits or fruit juice, but keep in mind that fruits have their own sugars; you just won't be adding any with the syrup base.\n10 Best Keto Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/keto-simple-syrup-5118128

Squeezing a bit of lemon juice over the flesh slows down the reaction and will keep your garnish beautiful.\n\nWhat is St. Germain?\nSt. Germain is a sweet liqueur that\'s flavored with elderflower, a flower that is used to make cordials, wine, and nonalcoholic drinks. Elderflowers primarily grow in the United Kingdom, and it is a tradition to use them to make homemade elderflower cordials in the summertime. In 2007, the St. Germain brand of elderflower liqueur was released. Marketed as a premium spirit, its soaring popularity gave this versatile liqueur a more prominent place on liquor store shelves, though there are a few other brands that produce this liqueur flavor as well. St. Germain also pairs nicely with gin, vodka, and whiskey, and you can even enjoy it over ice on its own.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer a nonalcoholic variation of this cocktail, use an elderflower drink concentrate or syrup.  Simply mix 2 ounces of the elderflower ingredient with 3 1/2 ounces of seltzer for a refreshing non-alcoholic beverage that makes it feel like summer no matter the time of year.\nCreate a grapefruit-elderflower mimosa by adding 2 to 3 tablespoons (1 to 1 1/2 ounces) of grapefruit juice to this recipe. Garnish it with fruit or fresh herbs such as thyme.\nAdd about 1 ounce of freshly squeezed blood orange juice to the St. Germain cocktail for a tartly sweet twist on the mimosa.\nFor a tropical flair, include an ounce or so of guava nectar along with the elderflower liqueur.\nBest Champagne for This Cocktail\nWhen mixing the bubbly stuff with other ingredients to make a cocktail, you don\'t want to use that very expensive bottle you\'ve been saving for a special occasion. This drink calls for a tasty but affordable Champagne. Other types of sparkling wine, such as cava or prosecco, tend to be less expensive but equally satisfying for cocktails.\nHow strong is the St. Germain cocktail?\nThe St. Germain cocktail may include liqueur, but it remains a relatively mild drink. It is just a little stronger than the average glass of wine. When using St. Germain, which is 40-proof, the drink weighs in around 13 percent alcohol by volume (ABV).\nThe Best Mimosas for a Fantastic Brunch']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/st-germain-cocktail-3884315

Be sure to zest before cutting the lime in half.\nIf you don't have a muddler, use a spoon that fits inside your shaker.\nA julep strainer works very well for keeping most of the mint out of the serving glass. You can also double strain the cocktail by pouring it through a fine-mesh strainer.\nWhat Alcohol Is Best for a Mojito?\nLight rum is a traditional choice for any mojito. Coconut rum is a fun option for this version; replace the light rum entirely or split the two. While you might be inclined to choose Malibu because it's a well-known brand, there are other coconut rums worth trying. An aged rum can be quite nice in mojitos, too. If vodka is your alcohol of choice, it will work as well, and coconut vodkas are available.\nRecipe Variations\nSimple syrup is a great substitute for granulated sugar because the sugar's already dissolved. You can make it with raw sugar (or your favorite type of sugar); use about 1/4 ounce of simple syrup in the coconut mojito, and add a little more to make it sweeter.\nCoconut cream will work in this mojito, as will coconut milk and?for a non-creamy, lighter drink?coconut water. When using unsweetened versions of these ingredients, double up on the sugar.\nMake a virgin coconut mojito by skipping the rum. Add a little more lime juice and soda, or replace the rum with coconut water or lime cordial.\nTry a blended coconut mojito. This mix creates a yummy frozen cocktail, and all you need to do is add the ingredients (hold the soda) to the blender with about one cup of ice. Pour it into the glass, and top with soda or skip it entirely.\nSince it's best when shaken, the cream of coconut version of this mojito is not ideal as a pitcher drink. You can, however, shake two cocktails at once if your shaker has the capacity. If you do want a big-batch coconut mojito, go with sweetened coconut milk (the carton variety, not canned) or coconut water, increase all the ingredients in proportion, and stir it very well in an ice-filled pitcher.\nHow Strong Is a Coconut Mojito?\nThe alcohol content of this coconut mojito recipe is a bit lighter than the average wine. When made with 80-proof light rum, it shakes up to about 10 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 20 proof). While that is relatively light, it is so sweet and delicious that you might be tempted to drink a few, and they will add up.\nPineapple Mojito Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/coconut-mojito-cocktail-recipe-5192585

For instance, Baileys and Merrys both make a strawberry-flavored Irish cream, and you may spot other brands as well.\nDepending on the vodka, you might not get a distinct layer on top of the creamy base. If it's not working out, try to reverse the ingredients, pouring the vodka first, then the cream liqueur.\nDrizzling the vodka instead is much easier and the effect of black swirls in thick pink liquid is cool on its own.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can replicate the look and (to some extent) the taste of Tequila Rose using two ingredients. Shake 1/2 ounce of Irish cream or RumChata and 1/4 ounce of strawberry liqueur, straining it into a shot glass. Raspberry liqueur (e.g., Chambord) or grenadine will work as well, though the flavor will change.\nBlack vodka makes a neat visual, but it's not required. You can get the same taste with a clear vodka. Though the majority of flavored vodkas are also colorless, you can pour something like Deep Eddy Cranberry, which is deep red. The taste would be good and you still get a color effect.\nHow Strong Is a Black Rose Shot?\nSince there's no shaking or mixing this shot up with ice that would dilute it, it's a very strong drink.

Serve and enjoy.\nShaken, Not Stirred\nThe recipe is easy enough, though many people prefer to stir it. The shake may actually be a good thing because it ensures extra dilution in this stiff drink.\nHow Strong Is a Vesper Martini?\nIt\'s said that vodka in the \'50s was often bottled at 100 proof and that Gordon\'s was 94 proof at the time (it\'s since been reformulated). Factoring those numbers in, the Vesper could easily be a 39 percent ABV (78 proof) cocktail. That\'s equivalent to a straight shot of most vodkas on the market today. It\'s also worth noting that this recipe creates a nearly 5-ounce drink with proper dilution, which is almost double the average alcohol-only martini.\nAnytime there\'s a debate over shaking versus stirring cocktails, one can\'t help but think of Bond\'s famous line, ""shaken, not stirred."" It first appeared in Fleming\'s 1956 novel, ""Diamonds Are Forever."" Bond drank many gin and vodka martinis throughout the books, and shaken cocktails seemed to be his preference. However, the general bartending ""rule"" is to stir liquor-only cocktails to avoid too much dilution.\nInterpreting Bond\'s Vesper Martini\nHere\'s how to make the Vesper according to Ian Fleming and James Bond: ""Three measures of Gordon\'s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it\'s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?"" (""Casino Royale,"" Chapter 7.)\nThe Kina Lillet (pronounced lee-lay) that Bond speaks of is a French aromatized wine that is no longer produced. It included quinine, which is also used in tonic water and contributes a bitter taste. Lillet Blanc replaced Kina Lillet, and it also originally included quinine, but that ingredient was dropped in the 1980s. Today\'s Lillet Blanc is softer and similar to dry vermouth (a fortified wine), only noticeably sweeter without the bitterness.\nRecipe Variations\nTo bring back the Vesper\'s hint of bitterness:\nSwap out the Lillet Blanc for Cocchi Americano, which carries the bitter note of the James Bond-era Kina Lillet.\nUse Lillet Blanc and add about 3 dashes of aromatic bitters.\nWhat\'s the Best Gin and Vodka for a Vesper Martini?\nThe Gordon\'s Gin available in the U.S. today is different than that found in the United Kingdom. Neither is the same Gordon\'s that Fleming knew because the recipe and strength have changed. While Gordon\'s is a good everyday gin, there are now plenty of better options to choose from. Nearly any top-shelf gin with a bold botanical profile will make a nice Vesper. Many people prefer Tanqueray or Beefeater, though some like the fruitier Plymouth Gin. As for the vodka, don\'t worry about the strength, and pour your favorite premium vodka.\nEat and Drink Like James Bond']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/vesper-martini-recipe-760130

Shake well.\nStrain into a chilled old-fashioned glass over fresh ice.\nFor Best Results\nHere are a few expert recommendations to make the best apple sour bourbon:\nBourbon: Unless you go for a really cheap bourbon, you won't find a bad bourbon to mix into this apple sour.\nApple juice: As with any other juice, it's important to choose a quality juice if you want the best-tasting cocktail. Choose something not overly processed or overly sweet. If using apple cider, use cold pressed without added sugar. Although other good-quality apple juices work well, cider adds an impressive depth of flavor to the apple sour. Likewise for the lemon juice, fresh is best.\nTriple sec: Not all triple sec is created equal, and you want a great-tasting one in your bar. Instead of thinking about triple sec as a secondary liqueur, consider it as you would a vodka because you will use it almost as often. Don't downgrade your beverages with a not-so-great triple sec. Pay up and enjoy the improvement in your cocktails.\nFizzy Apple Sour\nIf you would like to add a little sparkle to the cocktail, choose a sparkling juice. It's a fun alternative to regular apple juice, and the clean, natural taste works very well against the bourbon sour. You might even want to stick with regular juice and top the drink off with sparkling juice to create a taller, more refreshing beverage.\nHow Strong Is the Apple Sour?\nThe apple sour falls in line with similar whiskey cocktails and is mild but not weak. It's a very pleasant whiskey sipper and has an average alcohol content of 19 percent ABV (36 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/apple-sour-recipe-761407

A lemon twist is typically used as the garnish.\nWhere Was the Rob Roy Cocktail Invented?\nThe Rob Roy was created at the famous New York City Waldorf-Astoria in the 1890s. As is the case with many classic cocktails of the time, this one debuted along with the 1894 Broadway show, ""Rob Roy,"" which told the story of Robert Roy MacGregor, the Scottish Robin Hood of the 18th century. The cocktail was also instrumental in introducing the American public to blended Scotch whisky.\nHow Strong Is the Rob Roy?\nThe alcohol content of any Rob Roy cocktail is going to depend on the whisky you pour and the amount of vermouth you choose to include. When made with an 80-proof blended Scotch in the standard recipe, it mixes up to about 29 percent ABV (58 proof). That is definitely not a light drink, which is why ""straight-up"" drinks that include alcohol alone are served in such small portions.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rob-roy-cocktail-recipe-759335

It will take about one month to finish.\nThis recipe makes about 16 ounces or a little more than a pint of liqueur. It's best to start with this smaller batch until you perfect the recipe to your taste. Take notes on any adjustments you make, and once you have it where you like it, scale it up to make a larger batch.\nGather the ingredients.\nPeel and cut the lychee fruits in half. Add the pieces to a glass jar that has a capacity of at least 16 ounces. Add the zest of 1 lime, then fill the jar with the vodka.\nSeal the jar and give it a good shake.\nStore in a cool, dark place for four weeks, shaking it every couple of days. Give it a taste test after two weeks, then again a week later to see how the flavor is progressing. Four weeks will give it a good flavor, but it might take more to get to your ideal flavor.\nOnce the vodka is flavored to your liking, heavily strain the fruit from the vodka through a cheesecloth or a very clean kitchen towel. Be sure to squeeze all of the liquid from the lychee.\nStrain again to ensure all of the liquid is removed from the fruit. During this final straining, you can filter it directly into the bottle that will store the liqueur: Use a funnel and place the cheesecloth inside.\nAdd 1 cup of simple syrup to the bottle, tighten the lid, and shake vigorously. Store the finished liqueur in the refrigerator where it will keep for about three months.\nOr Make Lychee Syrup\nLychee syrup is very easy to make and is a great substitute for the lychee liqueur. It is no different than any other flavored syrup. You'll simply use lychee fruits for the flavor. It takes less than an hour from start to finish, and the finished syrup can be refrigerated for up to two weeks.\nThis recipe makes about 1 cup of syrup. It can be adjusted by increasing the sugar and water quantities in an equal manner.\nGather the ingredients.\nCombine 1 cup each of sugar and water in a saucepan.\nBring to a slow boil, stirring constantly until the sugar is completely dissolved.\nAdd the lychee fruit, reduce the heat, and cover.\nSimmer for about 10 minutes.\nRemove from the heat and allow to cool for about 30 minutes.\nStrain the fruit from the syrup and pour it into a glass bottle with a tight-sealing lid. It will keep in the refrigerator for two to three weeks.\nMake the Lychee Martini\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a cocktail shaker filled with ice, pour the vodka, lychee liqueur or syrup, and lime juice. Shake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with pitted lychee fruit. Serve and enjoy.\nIs There a Quicker Way of Making Lychee Liqueur?\nFor a shortcut liqueur, skip the one-month infusion and simply add 1 cup of lychee syrup to 375 milliliters of vodka. Add more vodka or syrup to taste.\nLychee Liqueur Tips\nFresh lychees are often available in the summer months and take a little preparation. You will need to peel the lychee and remove the stone. Only the fleshy white fruit is needed. To make this year-round, use canned lychee fruit. Buy it online, check the international aisle of upscale supermarkets, or go to grocery stores specializing in Asian produce.\nFor the finished liqueur, you will need a bottle or jar that holds at least 3 cups. It's a great way to recycle 750-milliliters liquor bottles.\nTest your liqueur after mixing in the syrup. It should be slightly sweet and have a soft lychee flavor. If it's not sweet enough, add more syrup in small amounts. Shake and test it with each new addition until it suits your taste.\nIf you find that the liqueur is lacking both sweetness and fruit flavor, make a lychee syrup and add it instead of plain syrup.\nUse your liqueur in margaritas, daiquiris, mojitos, and Champagne, gin, and rum cocktails.\nRecipe Variation\nYou can also make a lychee martini with a lychee-flavored vodka, such as the one offered by Kai Vodka. A few other brands produce it as well, though these tend to come and go on the market. You can also do your own lychee vodka infusion using the liqueur recipe without the syrup.\nFor the martini with lychee vodka, begin by pouring 2 ounces of lychee vodka, 3/4 ounce simple syrup (plain or lychee), and 1/4 ounce lime juice. Shake it up and see what you think. If needed, make adjustments to any of the ingredients to get your desired flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Lychee Martini?\nLike most martinis, this is not a light drink. When made with the average lychee liqueur, its alcohol content falls in the 25 percent ABV (50 proof) range.\nSmoothie With Lychee Fruit""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lychee-martini-with-homemade-liqueur-recipe-761097

It's optional, so feel free to skip it. If you do use it, ensure that your egg is good before adding it to the shaker.\nIf you do add the egg, this cocktail needs to be shaken longer than normal. Thirty seconds should be your goal. When the shaker gets a really good frost on the outside, it should be properly mixed.\nFresh citrus juice will produce the best tasting cocktail.

The higher the alcohol content, the more flavorful your drink will be, which is ideal for this recipe. Anything that's around 100 proof will stand out nicely against the drink's complex flavors.\nThough the recipe recommends serving the whiskey sour 101 on the rocks, it's great without ice as well.

The classic citrus juicer makes fast work of a few grapefruits, and it doesn\'t take up much space in the kitchen or bar. You should be able to get enough juice from a single grapefruit for one greyhound.\nWhen choosing store-bought juice, look for a quality brand without pulp or added sugar.\nRecipe Variations\nGrapefruit is a tart fruit, and some juices?whether fresh or bottled?are sharper than others.

The aperitif adds a hint of bitterness and transforms it into a great dinner drink. This version is really nice when sweetened with a dash of rosemary syrup, too.\nWhy Is It Called a Greyhound Drink?\nThe greyhound formula dates back to 1930. It appeared as a ""variation of the grapefruit cocktail"" in Harry Craddock\'s ""The Savoy Cocktail Book."" While the recipe he refers to used grapefruit jelly, his simplified version pairs gin with fresh grapefruit juice, sugar to taste, and plenty of ice. Vodka came into play in the 1940s, thanks to its growing popularity among American drinkers, as did the greyhound name. In 1945, the vodka drink appeared in Harper\'s Magazine, and by the \'50s, it was a popular libation at the Post House restaurants found at Greyhound bus terminals. With word from the traveling public, the drink\'s popularity soared.\nHow Strong Is the Greyhound?\nAs with all highball drinks, you can make the greyhound as light or as strong as you desire. It all depends on how much juice you pour. Four ounces is pretty standard, and with 80-proof vodka or gin, the drink weighs in around 12 percent ABV (24 proof). It\'s what you can expect from the average glass of wine.\nWhat Alcohol Is Good With Grapefruit Juice?\nThe distinct sweet-bitter taste of grapefruit is generally best paired with white spirits. The greyhound and salty dog prove that the citrus is great with vodka and gin. It\'s also an excellent match for tequila, as seen in the famous paloma, and white rum as found in the classic Nevada cocktail. For an interesting twist, try the grapefruit shandy with your favorite wheat beer.\n20 Cheap and Easy Mixed Drinks to Make at Home']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/greyhound-cocktail-recipe-759306

It also appeared in his 1927 book, ""Barflies, and Cocktails.""\nMacElhone was one of the many American bartenders who fled the United States during Prohibition, and he is most famous for his work at the Paris hotspot, Harry\'s New York Bar. Not only did this exodus of bartenders to Europe promote the fine cocktails being made in the U.S., but it also introduced the expatriates to new spirits.\nCampari was one of those that had not yet made it to America\'s shores, and once bartenders like MacElhone got a hold of it great things happened. The Boulevardier was just one of those now-iconic cocktails.\nThe story goes that MacElhone first mixed this cocktail up for a man named Erskine Gwynne, publisher of the Paris magazine, Boulevardier, a wealthy socialite, and related to the Vanderbilt family. Also an expatriate, it may have been Gwynne who actually came to Harry\'s with the Boulevardier recipe. As MacElhone writes in ""Barflies and Cocktails,"" ¡°Now is the time for all good barflies to come to the aid of the party since Erskine Gwynne crashed in with his Boulevardier Cocktail: 1/3 Campari, 1/3 Italian vermouth, 1/3 Bourbon whisky.¡±\nNotice that the ingredients were in equal proportion. Since that time, the recipe has been adapted to what some may call a more palatable recipe (the one listed above). Modern bartenders continue to tweak the recipe, and that\'s a good way to find your own ideal Boulevardier.\nHow to Make Boulevardiers for a Crowd\nMake one cocktail and measure its volume in ounces before and after stirring with ice and straining.

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nRim the glass with salt or mix it with cayenne pepper if you like. Be careful when pouring the beer because if it hits the salt, you may have a foamy mess. If you don\'t want the salty rim, add a pinch or two of salt to the drink.\nAdd a couple of dashes Maggi Liquid Seasoning to give it more dimension.\nAdd a pinch of celery salt, all-purpose meat seasoning, smoked paprika, or cayenne pepper.\nAdd a splash of tomato or clamato juice to give it more of a red beer feel.\nChoose Your Hot Sauce\nQuite honestly, the beer is secondary in importance when it comes to making a great michelada. What is more important is the hot sauce, and it can be used to give this drink a personal spin.\nThere are many hot sauce options available. Tabasco is always a favorite for spicy drinks, and it is one of the more popular options for the michelada.\nCholula is a great choice as well. It has less of that vinegar bitterness that is a signature of Tabasco. Give either the Original Cholula or their Chili Garlic a try in this drink (or any that call for hot sauce). You might find the drink has a better balance and more flavor.\nBeware of super spicy sauces. There are some hot sauces that take the spice to an extreme and it\'s best to be cautious about using any of these ""kick ass"" hot sauces to create spicy cocktails. They may be great for tacos, but it is very easy to burn drinks and make them undrinkable. What\'s the point of that?\nLess is definitely more when it comes to the hot sauce! No matter which you choose, start slowly. Just a few dashes will have a big impact on your michelada. You can always add more if you feel it needs it, just be sure to stir properly with each addition.\nMore Tips\nIt is customary to use a Mexican beer in the michelada. These tend to be very light lagers with rather transparent flavors, just the kind of beer that needs a little spicing up! Corona may be the obvious choices for American drinkers, but you might want to try something like Bohemia Clasica or Tecate. Darker beers like Negra Modelo or Dos Equis make an interesting michelada as well.\nChoose a good soy sauce to improve your michelada; the best options are not next to the ramen noodles at the average grocer. Instead, take a trip to an international food market and explore their options.\nHow Strong Is the Michelada?\nThe michelada has a beer-only base, so it is a very light drink. To estimate its alcohol content, let\'s use Bohemia Clasica as an example. Factoring in a little ice melt with the 4.7 percent ABV beer brings the michelada down to a very mild 3.7 percent ABV. Pretty much count on any beer being reduced by 1 percentage point.\nGoogle Just Released the Top Trending Super Bowl Dip Recipes by State for 2022']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spicy-michelada-mexican-beer-recipe-759731

Instead, begin with a little heavy whipping cream and vigorously whip it with a whisk or fork until it is light and fluffy.\nWe Tested the Best Non-electric Coffee Makers?Here Are Our Top Picks\nWho Created the Irish Coffee?\nThe Irish coffee was created by chef Joe Sheridan in 1942. He ran the restaurant at the Foynes airbase outside of Limerick, Ireland. The story goes that an evening flying boat flight returned to the airport after a failed attempt to reach New York during a winter storm. Sheridan mixed up the first round of Irish coffees for the stranded passengers. One surprised American asked, ""Hey Buddy, is this Brazilian coffee?"" ""No,"" said Joe, ""that\'s Irish coffee."" Later, Sheridan used his Irish wit to explain how to make a true Irish coffee:\nCream - Rich as an Irish Brogue\nCoffee - Strong as a Friendly Hand\nSugar - Sweet as the tongue of a Rogue\nWhiskey - Smooth as the Wit of the Land\nHow Did the Irish Coffee Become so Famous?\nIn 1952, a travel writer by the name of Stanton Delaplane was one of the many travelers who became enamored by the Irish coffee. He is credited with bringing the recipe to the United States, specifically to the attention of bartender Jack Koeppler at San Francisco\'s Buena Vista Caf?. When Koeppler tried to make the drink, the cream kept sinking, so he traveled to the source to learn the correct way to make an Irish coffee. He ended up offering Joe Sheridan a position at his cafe, where millions of Irish coffees have been made over the years. For a true taste of the original, order one at the Foynes museum in Ireland or the Buena Vista.\nHow Strong Is the Irish Coffee?\nWhen made with an 80-proof whiskey in the measurements given in the recipe, the Irish coffee is relatively gentle at right around 9 percent ABV (18 proof). While the alcohol effect may be minimal, drinking Irish coffee will keep some people awake. If you don\'t usually drink caffeine at night, use decaffeinated coffee.\n\nSt. Patrick\'s Day Drinks & Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/original-irish-coffee-recipe-759311

Let it sit while you prepare the rest of the drink.\nIn a mixing glass, soak the sugar cube with the bitters and muddle to crush the cube.\nAdd the rye whiskey and stir.\nDiscard the ice in the chilled glass. Rinse it with absinthe: Pour a small amount into the glass, swirl it around, then discard the liquid.\nPour the whiskey mixture into the absinthe-rinsed glass.\nGently squeeze the lemon twist over the drink to release its essence. Traditionalists typically discard it and rarely drop it into the glass; lay it on the rim as a garnish if you like. Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nWith nearly two centuries of history, it\'s understandable that the Sazerac recipe has been mixed in various ways over the years. Even the official cocktail has undergone a number of revisions. Explore these variations to taste the impact that even the slightest change can make.\nSazerac recommends a 1 1/2-ounce pour of whiskey, though many drinkers prefer to pour between 2 and 3 ounces. With more whiskey, you may want a second sugar cube.\nSplit the rye whiskey with an equal part of cognac. Typically, each is a 1 1/4-ounce pour.\nMuddle the sugar cube with a splash of water, then add the bitters to the whiskey.\nUse a combination of bitters.\nFor a bit of dilution, stir the whiskey mix with a few small ice cubes, then strain into the rinsed glass.\nUse 1 teaspoon of rich (2:1) simple syrup instead of a sugar cube. Add it to the mix of rye whiskey and bitters with ice, stir, and strain.\nAt one point, the official recipe recommended bourbon as an alternative to rye whiskey. You may want to experiment with bourbons, although this will not be traditional Sazerac, without the spicy profile of rye.\nIf you don\'t care for the flavor of anise, try another liqueur besides absinthe for the rinse. Of course, it will not be a true Sazerac, but it can be just as interesting. A blood orange Sazerac uses orange liqueur for the rinse, rye for the whiskey, and orange bitters.\nHow to Make Sazeracs for a Crowd\nTo make a large batch of Sazeracs for a party, follow these steps:\nPrepare a batch of rich simple syrup (using 2 parts sugar to 1 part water) and use 1 teaspoon per drink instead of a sugar cube.\nMultiply each ingredient by the number of servings you want to make. Do not include the absinthe in your calculations (we\'ll come back to that in a bit).\nFor the bitters, divide the number you got in Step Two by 2. Bitters tend to become more pronounced over time in batched cocktails so you don\'t need to use as much.\nUse the resulting numbers to help you figure out how many bottles of rye whiskey you\'ll need to buy. Remember that drinks are usually sold in 750mL bottles. 750mL is approximately 25 1/4 ounces.\nOnce you have your ingredients, measure them out according to the math you did in Steps 2 and 3.\nMix the ingredients together, place in a serving vessel, and set aside. Sazeracs are notably not chilled before serving, but they are served in chilled glasses. Place the glasses in which you plan to serve the drink in the freezer.\nIf you have one, fill a small atomizer with absinthe.\nFor each drink, spritz the glass lightly with absinthe. You can also rinse the glass with absinthe as directed in the recipe above. Measure out 2 1/2 to 3 ounces of the cocktail and pour it into the absinthe-rinsed glass. Garnish as directed.\nHow Strong Is the Sazerac?\nSazerac rye whiskey is a 90-proof liquor. Even if you dilute it slightly by stirring it with ice, the Sazerac cocktail is really no different than drinking the whiskey straight?it\'s merely enhanced. This means the Sazerac is in the 45 percent ABV (90 proof) range and is one of the strongest mixed drinks you can make.\nWhere Was the Sazerac Invented?\nThe story of the Sazerac cocktail began in 1838 when Antoine Amedie Peychaud, a New Orleans apothecary, mixed cognac with his proprietary Peychaud\'s Bitters. In the 1850s, this ""toddy"" (not a hot toddy, but an early name for a cocktail) was the signature drink of the Sazerac Coffee House in New Orleans. That\'s where it received its name and became the first ""branded"" cocktail. In 1869, bartender Thomas H. Handy purchased the bar from Sewell Taylor. A few years later, he added Peychaud\'s Bitters to the portfolio of his growing liquor business, which would become the Sazerac Company.\n\nBy the 1890s, rye whiskey took over for the brandy, and Handy was selling bottled Sazeracs. In the 1940s, Herbsaint became the anise liqueur of choice, primarily due to the longtime ban of absinthe in the U.S. (it was lifted in 2007). Today, Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Straight Rye Whiskey is a very pricy bottle; Sazerac Rye Whiskey is reasonably priced for the average drinker.\nWhat\'s the Difference Between an Old-Fashioned and a Sazerac?\nThere are similar elements to these drinks, as both contain bitters and a citrus twist, but the base spirit is different.\nThe old-fashioned\'s base is bourbon, whereas the Sazerac\'s base is rye whiskey.\nThe old-fashioned typically uses Angostura bitters, but the Sazerac favors Peychaud\'s.\nThe old-fashioned\'s garnish is typically orange; the Sazerac tends toward lemon.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sazerac-cocktail-recipe-760604

Blended whiskeys tend to be a bit more affordable and the flavor more universal than many of the single malts.\nHow Strong Is the Blood and Sand?\nCompared to other ""up"" cocktails like the Rob Roy, the Blood and Sand is mild.

The Black and Tans were a group that assisted the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) during the Irish War of Independence (1919?1921). Known for violent tactics, the name Black and Tan brings back memories of a tragic time in Ireland\'s history and is seen as offensive. Instead, ask for your Guinness straight from the tap or try ordering a ""half and half."" The same etiquette rule applies to the Irish slammer (for years known as the Irish car bomb).\nHow Strong Is a Black and Tan?\nThe alcohol content of a black and tan is simply an average of the two beers you pour. For example, if you go with the standard Bass Pale Ale and Guinness combination, it comes out to about 4.7 percent ABV.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are many other layered beer combinations that work.

Add a cherry if you like.\nRecipe Variations\nFor much of the 20th century, the old-fashioned was muddled with an orange slice and topped with a splash of club soda and a maraschino cherry. It\'s a nice drink but many bartenders have reverted to the simpler version.\nWhen using granulated sugar (rather than a cube), it\'s common to add 1 teaspoon of water, then stir until the sugar dissolves.\nAlternatively, use a splash (barely 1 teaspoon) of simple syrup instead of granulated sugar, mixing it with the bitters before adding ice and whiskey.\nAdding an orange slice or peel to the muddle is a modern twist. The earliest old-fashioneds barely used the fruit as a garnish. Some bartenders pair a lemon peel with certain whiskeys and some use both orange and lemon peels.\nAngostura aromatic bitters are the classic choice, though today\'s market includes a great variety of bitters. Orange bitters are nice, and any whiskey barrel-aged bitters are a natural accent for the drink. Some whiskeys can even handle unusual flavors such as chocolate, peach, or rhubarb.\nHow To Make Old-Fashioneds for a Crowd\nThe Old-Fashioned is a very simple drink, but mixing them one at a time for a crowd is still time-consuming. To mix a large batch of Old-Fashioneds for a party, follow these steps:\nMultiply each ingredient by the number of servings you want to make. Use granulated sugar instead of sugar cubes.\nFor the bitters, divide the number you got in Step 1 by 2.

Garnish as desired.\nRead more about how to batch cocktails here.\nThe Pendennis Club Myth\nFor decades, the creation of the old-fashioned was attributed to the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky. David Wondrich points out in his book ""Imbibe!"" that this is false: The club opened in 1881, but a year before that, ""old-fashioned cocktails"" were mentioned in the Chicago Tribune. There was even an ""ambiguous newspaper squib"" that mentioned old-fashioned drinks as early as 1869.\nIn truth, the old-fashioned formula dates back to the 1850s, if not earlier. It was made with whiskey, brandy, or gin (Old Tom or ""Holland,"" better known today as genever). It was quite simply liquor, sugar (not syrup), and ice. Add bitters, and you have the original definition of a cocktail.\nFollow the Historical Advice on Ice\nWithin Wondrich\'s old-fashioned notes is a fascinating section about the proper ice to use in this drink. It turns out that ice balls and 2-inch cubes are nothing new; they just got lost in the American bar until a relatively recent revival. The large cube\'s reference dates to 1899, when ""...mixologically ambitious saloons preferred to refrigerate their old-fashioned with ice cut into \'perfect cubes about two inches on a side.\'""\nIt follows the same theory used to chill and slightly dilute straight whiskey. Those fancy ice machines that are so convenient today and produce tiny, fast-melting ""cubes"" ruined it for many years. If you are an old-fashioned devotee and have not made the switch to 2-inch ice, it\'s the last step in perfecting this drink.\nHow Strong Is the Old-Fashioned?\nThe old-fashioned is definitely a strong drink. With little dilution and no significant mixer, it\'s not much lighter than a straight pour of whiskey. The alcohol content of an old-fashioned made with an 80-proof whiskey falls around 32 percent ABV (64 proof).

Add ice into the glass, and pour the cream in last.\nStir well. Serve and enjoy.\nChoose Your Cream\n\nChoose good-quality vodka, but also pay attention to the cream:\nHeavy cream is a popular choice because it is thicker, only a small amount is used in the drink, and it becomes lighter as the ice melts.\nLight cream and half-and-half are both good prospects, but whole milk is a go-to as well for the simple fact that more people have milk rather than cream in the fridge. Milk, however, produces a rather thin drink.\nFor a dairy-free drink use soy, almond, rice, or any of the other nut- or grain-based beverages.\nFlavorful Additions and Substitutions\nBerry infused vodka adds another bold dimension to the drink.\nCake and whipped cream vodkas, or espresso, chocolate, and vanilla vodkas are also great choices.\nKahl?a is the most popular coffee liqueur used in a White Russian, but Firelit, New Deal, or Leopold Bros. are also great choices.\n\nOther White- and Black Russian-inspired drinks will use different liquors and spirits like:\nAmaretto for a toasted almond, tequila for a brave bull, brandy for a separator, Irish cream liqueur for a mudslide, or rye whiskey for a sneaky Pete\nFor a fun take on the drink, transform the White Russian into a frozen ice pop \nHow Strong Is the White Russian?\nIf we were to use an 80-proof vodka and mix the White Russian according to the recipe above, it would be approximately 24 percent ABV (48 proof). Even though it will mellow a bit as the ice melts, it is a deceptive cocktail and a little more potent than you may think, so take it easy.\nWhich Vodka Is Best for Cocktails?\nThe biggest question with cocktails is which vodka to use. The simple answer for the White Russian is to use whatever vodka you like. The strong flavors of the other ingredients will disguise any impurities in the vodka used, so use your favorite ""well"" vodka and not the finest one in your bar. There are many great-tasting and inexpensive vodkas available to choose from.\nWhy Is It Called a White Russian?\nThe name ""white Russian"" simply refers to the cocktail\'s main ingredient and color. It\'s a variation of the black Russian, which is dark because of the coffee liqueur. In the 1940s, vodka was being heavily marketed to American drinkers. Similar to the Moscow mule, this pair of drinks took on a Russian name because the Soviet Union was the biggest vodka exporter at the time.\n18 Easy Infused Vodka Cocktails']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/white-russian-recipe-761274

It can work well with the traditional London dry gins like Beefeater and Tanqueray and is equally delightful with any of the lighter gins, such as Hendrick's, Aviation, or any other new gin you come across.\nTo really ensure the egg is mixed into the drink, dry shake it first. Before adding ice, give all the ingredients a good 30-second shake. Fill the shaker with ice, then shake again for 30 seconds, or until your arms get tired.\nWhat Is Applejack?\nApplejack is an old-fashioned apple brandy. A product of the oldest distillery in the United States, this brandy is made through the process of jacking, thus the name. By freezing fermented cider and then periodically removing the frozen parts, the alcohol concentration keeps increasing in the remaining liquid.\nApplejack is very popular to use in classic cocktails like the pink lady, and it's worth the effort to seek the classic Laird & Company brand, although other apple brandies make a good substitute.\nHow Strong Is the Pink Lady?\nThe pink lady may be a pretty little cocktail, but she does pack a punch. Yet, it's really no different than the average classic martini-style cocktail, which is often made primarily of liquor. Assuming you opt to include the egg white, you can expect this cocktail to weigh in around 25 percent ABV (50 proof).\nGot Applejack Sour?

Bottle in the original vodka bottle or a similar glass jar with a tight lid.\nTips\nUse a large glass jar with a wide mouth and tight-fitting lid for the infusion. A 1-quart jar might work, though a 2-quart jar will leave plenty of room for all the flavoring ingredients.\nYou can flavor the tomato vodka with other herbs and spices that are commonly paired with tomato in something like a marinara sauce.

Add the raw sugar and stir until completely dissolved.\nRemove from the heat. The light foam caused by the warm pineapple juice will dissipate after a few minutes; stirring speeds this up.\nLet the syrup cool completely before bottling in a jar with a tight seal. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\nMake the Pineapple Mojito\nGather the ingredients.\nIn a collins glass, add the raw sugar pineapple syrup, pineapple chunks, lime wedges, and torn mint leaves. Muddle well to mash the fruits.\nAdd the rum and fill the glass with ice.\nTop with club soda.\nGarnish with a sprig of mint, pineapple wedge, and lime slice.\nTips\nLight rum is often considered the best alcohol for a mojito, and aged rum is an excellent alternative. Pour your favorite brand of rum or explore other options; mid-range to top-shelf are preferred in a fresh fruit cocktail like this. If vodka's your preference, it makes a nice pineapple mojito as well.\nSome mojito drinkers prefer a cocktail that doesn't have pieces of mint and fruit in the glass. While not the typical method for mixing mojitos, you can shake and strain the cocktail over fresh ice; double straining traps the finer herb and fruit bits.\nTo make a few drinks at once, line up all of the glasses and work your way down the line as you build the cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nRaw sugar gives the syrup a rich, dark background that's fantastic against the bright taste of pineapple juice. You can use another sweetener, including white granulated sugar or coconut sugar. To make a low-sugar syrup, use an allulose monk fruit sweetener and replace half the water with pineapple juice (even unsweetened pineapple juice is not sugar-free or keto-friendly).\nSkip the flavored syrup entirely and use 3/4 ounce each of plain simple syrup and pineapple juice.\nFor a pitcher of mojitos, add 1/2 cup of fresh mint leaves to the pineapple syrup and strain them out once the syrup cools. Add 1 cup of the mint-pineapple syrup to a pitcher along with 1 1/2 cups of light rum, 1 to 1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice, and 2 cups of soda. It can be made in advance and kept chilled, but hold the soda until you're ready to serve.\nFor a virgin pineapple mojito, replace the rum with pineapple juice and switch from club soda to ginger ale.\nHow Strong Is the Pineapple Mojito?\nTypical of any mojito, the alcohol content of the pineapple mojito is around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). You can make it weaker by pouring less rum or more soda, though it's always going to be a little lighter than a glass of wine.\nVodka Mojito Recipe""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pineapple-mojito-recipe-760474

Use a swizzle stick or bar spoon to churn the ingredients into a frosty mix.\nFill the glass with more crushed ice and top with club soda.\nGarnish with a sprig of fresh mint and a lime slice.\nTips\nDue to its clean, fresh flavor, the vodka mojito is best with premium vodka. Pour your favorite brand; one that you enjoy drinking straight is a good choice.\nMint leaves vary in size, and you can add more or less according to your personal taste.\nRich simple syrup is sweeter than standard simple syrup and made with two parts sugar and one part water.\nMuddlers are useful for a variety of cocktails beyond the mojito, including the old-fashioned and mint julep. If you don't have a muddler, a spoon will work in this recipe, though it's not as efficient at mashing fruits if you choose to add them.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than lime juice, muddle a few lime slices or wedges with the mint and simple syrup.\nIf you don't have simple syrup, use two teaspoons of white or raw granulated sugar. Muddle it with the lime juice until the sugar is completely dissolved, then add the mint and muddle gently.\nCitrus vodka is an excellent alternative to unflavored vodka. Other flavored vodkas, such as berry, coconut, or pineapple are fun, too.\nIt's easy to increase this recipe for quick party service. Like the rum-based pitcher mojito, use a mint simple syrup: Combine about one cup of mint syrup with an equal amount of fresh lime juice, 1 1/2 cups of vodka, and 2 cups of club soda. Adjust the ingredients to taste.\nMake a keto vodka mojito by using a sugar-free sweetener. You can even make keto simple syrup for cocktails; an allulose monk fruit sweetener works best and doesn't have a bitter aftertaste.\nAdd fresh seasonal fruits, such as a handful of berries or melon chunks to the muddle for a flavor twist.\nFor a virgin mojito, skip the vodka and increase the mint, syrup, and soda.\nHow Strong Is a Vodka Mojito?\nMost mojitos contain a moderate amount of alcohol, and this vodka mojito follows suit. When made with the standard 80-proof vodka, it should fall in the 11 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 22 proof) range. The crushed ice adds more dilution than cubes, which produces a slightly lighter drink.

Beat the mixture to soft peaks again.\nAdd the egg whites to the chilled egg yolk mixture, folding it in gently.\nServe the eggnog in mugs, Irish coffee glasses, punch cups, or stemless martini glasses and grate nutmeg over the top for a garnish.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.\nTips\nMake sure you're using the freshest eggs when making drinks with raw eggs. With proper attention to the freshness and quality of your eggs and how you handle them, you reduce the risk of food poisoning from bacteria like salmonella, and your eggnog will likely be perfectly safe for guests.\nThe USDA recommends pasteurized eggs for any food or drink that uses raw eggs.1 The pasteurization process kills any bacteria that may be inside the shell, though some people find that there's a loss in flavor.\nMaking traditional eggnog requires a lot of vigorous mixing. While you can do it all with a whisk, using a stand or hand mixer whenever possible makes the task much easier.\nThere are three popular liquor options for eggnog: bourbon, brandy, and rum. Many people prefer bourbon, brandy is the traditional choice, and aged rum adds a similar oaky sweetness. For more dimension, try equal parts of bourbon and either brandy or aged rum.\nRecipe Variations\nReplace nutmeg with cinnamon or split the two spices when making the eggnog base.\nMake nonalcoholic eggnog and allow guests to spike their own glass. Simply skip the liquor in this recipe, and you'll have five cups of eggnog. For a one-cup serving, add a 1-ounce shot of alcohol to each glass, then top it with about seven ounces of prepared eggnog.\nMake eggnog by the glass in a cocktail shaker when you're not hosting a large party.\nSkip the eggs and dairy and go with vegan eggnog.\nAdd simple flavors to the eggnog base with a few extra ingredients. For instance, Fireball eggnog adds a shot of cinnamon whiskey, while the gingerbread eggnog recipe relies on molasses and a handful of spices.\nHow to Store Eggnog\nIn a well-sealed container, the eggnog's creamy yolk base will last for two to three days in the fridge because the alcohol acts as a preservative. Hold the egg whites until you're ready to serve; either refrigerate them in an air-tight container for a few days or freeze the egg whites for longer storage. Let the whites reach room temperature before whipping. Drink nonalcoholic eggnog within a day.\n\nSome people enjoy the taste of aged eggnog. It's an old-fashioned method that stores the eggnog base (no whites) for a long time to let the flavor develop further. When doing this, be extra diligent about egg safety, increase the recipe's ratio to two parts dairy and one part liquor, and store it in a glass jar with a tight seal. Keep it refrigerated for up to two weeks. The extra alcohol extends the shelf life, and you can always add a bit of milk or cream if it's too potent.\nHow Strong Is Eggnog?\nEggnog has a reputation for being too strong. In most cases, that's due to a generous host who adds a little too much booze, or guests who enjoy too many glasses. If you pour 80-proof liquor in this eggnog, the alcohol content falls around 6 percent ABV (12 proof). It's equivalent to the average beer and an ideal range for any punch-style drink.\nHow to Make Cooked Eggnog\nThe trick to cooked eggnog is to temper the eggs by adding the warm dairy ingredients to the egg yolks so the temperature rises gently and prevents scrambled eggs. The entire mix is then brought up to 160 F, the minimum temperature for eggs that destroys bacteria.2 The secret to success is to keep stirring whenever you're working with the warm mix.\nBeat the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt according to the recipe.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, stir constantly and gently warm the milk and heavy cream until steaming, but not to a boil.\nWhile whisking vigorously, very slowly pour the warm milk into the egg yolk bowl.\nReturn the mixture to the saucepan, stir continually, and cook over medium heat until it reaches 160 F on a thermometer. The mixture should thicken slightly but not be allowed to curdle.\nRemove the eggnog base from the heat, pour into a medium mixing bowl (through a fine-mesh strainer, if desired, to remove any film or curdled bits that may form), and let cool to room temperature.\nStir in the brandy. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour.\n\nWith this method, you can eliminate the egg whites and enjoy creamy cooked eggnog?it yields about four cups or four standard servings. If you want the foamy top, you can fold in the whipped egg whites then reheat the entire mixture to 160 F before chilling it again. Alternatively, whip 1/2 cup of heavy cream and fold it into the cooked eggnog base.\nIs eggnog served hot or cold?\nEggnog is often served chilled or at room temperature, though some people enjoy slightly warm eggnog. If you'd like to try it, let the finished eggnog reach room temperature, then gently it in a saucepan while constantly stirring just until it begins to steam.\n20 Best Classic and Modern Eggnog Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-eggnog-traditional-recipe-759687

Make sure you leave some headspace room for the eggnog to expand during freezing.\nHow Strong Is This Bourbon Eggnog?\nWe often hear the horror stories and running jokes about someone having a little too much eggnog at the Christmas party. It may surprise you to learn that the average eggnog is actually quite light (unless, of course, you add too much liquor). \n\nWhen made according to this recipe, your eggnog should be right around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). This means that one cup of eggnog should be about as strong as a glass of wine.\nCreating Delicious Dairy Cocktails at Home""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bourbon-eggnog-for-a-holiday-party-4119060

Dry shake without ice.\nFill the shaker with ice, then shake vigorously for about 30 seconds to ensure the egg yolk is fully incorporated.\nStrain into an old-fashioned or cocktail glass.\nAdd a dash of grated nutmeg or cinnamon as a garnish. Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly cooked eggs poses a risk of foodborne illness.\nTips\nMost brandies will make a tasty eggnog. Keep quality in mind and don't be too much of a cheapskate, though. A great eggnog deserves a nice brandy, and there are good options available in all price ranges.\nIt is crucial that you use a fresh egg. Simply place it in a glass of water to test the egg's freshness. If the egg floats, discard it because that means the egg is too old. For any egg cocktail, only use eggs that rest on the bottom. This will ensure the best-tasting drink and reduce the risk of salmonella.\nIf you like, you can use a pasteurized egg yolk, or an egg yolk substitute, though a real egg does create the best-tasting eggnog.\nWhen shaking drinks with eggs, it's best to do two separate rounds of shaking. By starting out with a dry shake, then adding ice, and shaking longer and with more vigor than normal, you'll ensure that the yolk gets broken up and thoroughly mixes with the other ingredients. If your arms hurt, that's the sign of a good shake.\nRecipe Variations\nBrandy is one of the traditional bases for eggnog, but it's not your only option. Rum has long been a favorite, and many whiskies make a nice eggnog as well. In fact, this recipe is perfect for trying out all three liquors to see which you enjoy most. You will be amazed at the differences, and the experiment is a lot of fun.\nFor rum, stick with aged or gold rums. White rums tend to get lost in the mix, and spiced rums can be too much spice for some drinkers. This is especially true if you have digestive issues.\nWhiskey is another story. Each style, and each brand will create a different flavor profile in your eggnog. Bourbon, rye whiskey, and blended Canadian whisky are preferred options but don't discount Irish whiskey.\nHow Strong Is This Eggnog?\nEggnog has a reputation for getting holiday revelers a little too tipsy. That may be due to drinking one cup too many or an overpouring host. In reality, this particular recipe is relatively mild, and its alcohol content will fall around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That's about the same as the strongest wines, so don't blame the eggnog.\n20 Festive Christmas Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-eggnog-recipe-759651

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIt's said that an even number of olives is bad luck, though this could just be an old bar tale.\nAs with any of the basic martinis, adjust the gin-vermouth ratio to your liking. You can also shake the drink if you prefer.\nKeep olives refrigerated. It's a common mistake in bars: Some bartenders make a dirty martini using warm juice from the garnish tray. It's a bad habit that's also unsanitary. Luckily, many have changed their ways and are either refrigerating separate brine for martinis or using bottled olive juice.\nWhat's the Difference Between Olive Brine and Olive Juice?\nIn the cocktail world, olive juice and brine tend to mean the same thing, but there is a difference. Olives produce juice, which is pressed out of the fruit to make products like olive oil and the brine (salted water) for cured olives. \nMany people prefer to use the brine that is in a jar of olives for dirty martinis. And why not? If you have olives, you have salty juice right there. It is a very convenient and cheap addition to the drink. Plus, with all the gourmet olives available?stuffed with everything from the standard pimento to blue cheese or jalape?o?each brine brings a slightly different taste to the martini.\nThere are also many olive juices available that are designed specifically for the dirty martini. They can vary quite a bit in taste, though they're interesting to explore. It may take some time to discover which bottled olive juice you like best, so keep trying. Dirty Sue is a favorite for many dirty martini devotees. You might also try the cocktail-worthy olive juices from Boscoli, Fee Brothers, Filthy, Fragata, or Stirrings.\nRecipe Variations\nSome bartenders suggest using a few dashes of extra-virgin olive oil instead of brine. It adds just a hint of olive flavor beyond what the garnish can deliver. Just be sure it is only 1 or 2 dashes, or you will create an oil slick in your glass.\nFilthy Martini: Replace the olive brine and garnish with caperberries (larger than capers) and the brine they're packaged in. Some recipes use up to 1 ounce of caper brine.\nDirty Gibson: Dirty martini meets Gibson cocktail; swap out the olive brine and garnish for cocktail onions and brine. The pickled onion provides a slight umami undertone.\nMake Your Own Olive Brine\nIf your local market has an olive bar filled with gourmet olives, use them to make olive brine. It is effortless and allows you to customize the selection of olives, even adding a variety to a single jar.\nThe best part is that you are in control of the juice and can formulate it to suit your taste perfectly. This simple DIY project can save the die-hard dirty martini drinker a considerable amount of money. As a bonus, you also get a custom choice of olives for garnishing all of your martinis.\nTo make a basic brine, you will need 2 cups of green olives, 2 cups water, 1/2 cup dry vermouth, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 2 tablespoons salt. Any of these can be adjusted to taste as you perfect your recipe.\nPlace the olives in a glass jar with a tight-sealing lid. Recycled olive jars are a natural choice, and Mason jars work great as well.\nGently press the olives with the back of a wooden spoon firmly enough to release their juice. Try not to smash them as if you're muddling fruit for a cocktail.\nIn a bowl, combine the other ingredients and mix well.\nPour the liquid over the olives until they are completely covered. Leave a little room for air at the top of the jar.\nSeal the jar and shake it vigorously.\nRefrigerate for at least one day (longer is better) and shake before using the juice.\nIf your juice gets a little low for the olives left in the jar, add more vermouth and give the mix a good shake.\nHow Strong Is the Dirty Martini?\nMartinis are not weak drinks and that is why they're served between 3 to 4 ounces per serving. With an 80-proof gin and the average vermouth, this dirty martini recipe is a heavyweight. Its alcohol content is around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).\nGin Cocktail Recipes""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/dirty-martini-cocktail-recipe-759643

Fill the shaker with ice.\nShake vigorously for about 10 seconds.\nStrain into an old-fashioned glass over fresh ice.\nGarnish with a few skewered maraschino cherries and an orange slice.\nTips\nTo find that delicate balance of sweet and sour that makes this drink special, measure the ingredients carefully using a jigger or shot glass. You may need to adjust the lemon juice or simple syrup as you switch brands of amaretto.\nRather than the bright red maraschino cherries, which are bleached and dyed, use real maraschino cherries (e.g., Luxardo brand), or try making spiced brandied cherries.\nAn Egg White Amaretto Sour\nMany sour cocktails are a little more enjoyable when you add egg white to the mix. It's a simple way to amplify the drink and creates a frothy top that is simply luscious. Be sure to use only the freshest egg and separate the white from the yolk.\nTo mix the egg white amaretto sour, add an egg white to the recipe. Dry shake the ingredients without ice, then fill the shaker with ice cubes and shake vigorously for at least 30 seconds before straining.\nPortland, Oregon bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler's version is a favorite in bars and restaurants. It adds 3/4 ounce of cask-strength bourbon to the mix and uses 1 1/2 ounces of amaretto, one teaspoon of rich simple syrup, and 1/2 ounce of egg white.\nRecipe Variations\nThe amaretto sour is best when shaken because the extra dilution mellows and marries the flavors and aerates the cocktail. If you want to fill a pitcher for a party, it may be best to shake a few cocktails in batches (multiply the recipe for as many drinks as your shaker will hold) then strain them into the pitcher. Pour into ice-filled glasses.\nYou can stir a full pitcher, but you will need to do so vigorously for at least 30 seconds with a lot of ice. To make a six-serving pitcher, use 1 1/2 cups of amaretto, 3/4 cups of fresh lemon juice, and about 1/8 cup of simple syrup. Taste and adjust the lemon juice and syrup as needed.\nSwitch to an orange-infused simple syrup to give this drink nice citrus notes and extra dimension.\nOne popular version of the amaretto sour uses sour mix and lemon-lime soda (quite often Sprite). Try this one with two ounces of amaretto and one ounce of sour mix; shake or stir with ice, then top the glass with soda. It's best with homemade sour mix.\nThe easiest way to make a virgin amaretto sour is to use a nonalcoholic amaretto. Zero-proof liqueurs are becoming more popular, and brands like Lyre's produce very good replicas of the liqueur.\nAnother intriguing nonalcoholic amaretto sour uses pineapple and amaretto syrup (a popular coffee sweetener). Try two ounces of pineapple juice and one ounce each of lemon juice and amaretto syrup for this mix. A few dashes of almond extract can replace the amaretto syrup if you use plain simple syrup.\nHow Strong Is an Amaretto Sour?\nThough the alcohol content varies slightly, amaretto is, on average, a 17 percent ABV (34 proof) liqueur. That's a pretty light base for a cocktail when compared to whiskey, vodka, and similar spirits. It also means that the amaretto sour is pleasantly light, weighing in around 9 percent ABV (18 proof) or a little lighter than a glass of wine. An amaretto sour with bourbon will be a bit stronger.\n25 Best Amaretto Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/simple-amaretto-sour-cocktail-recipe-5201292

Then again, B?n?dictine can also transform a less expensive brandy into a very enjoyable drink.\nIf you pour cognac, the drink is called a Cognac and B?n?dictine.\nRecipe Variations\nYou can also use the back of a bar spoon to gently float the brandy on top of the liqueur. \nSnifters have a deep bowl, so swirling the drink around in the glass is a great way to mix it, too. It wakes up the aroma and flavor as you drink.\nIf you prefer a slightly warmed B&B, partially fill the snifter with warm water and let it rest for a few minutes. Discard the water before adding the spirits.\nA very similar drink, the beautiful cocktail mixes cognac with Grand Marnier.\nWhat Is B&B Liquor?\nBottles of B&B are a pre-mixed version of this cocktail. Produced by B?n?dictine, it's a blend of 60 percent B?n?dictine liqueur and 40 percent French brandy that's aged in French oak barrels and bottled at 40 percent ABV (80 proof). B&B was first made in 1937, making it one of the oldest bottled cocktails. It can simply be served on the rocks but also makes an excellent addition to hot and cold coffee drinks, including the affogato, an Italian gelato-espresso dessert. Some cocktail recipes, such as the peary bird, use it as an ingredient just like any other liqueur.\nHow Strong Is the B&B?\nEnjoying a B&B is more about the experience than how much alcohol you're taking in. It's meant to be enjoyed slowly and savored for its exquisite taste, but it's also good to realize that it is strong. Most brandy is 80 proof, as is B?n?dictine, so if you mix the two without ice, the B&B is 80-proof as well. A bit of dilution from ice knocks it down slightly, to about 34 percent ABV (68 proof).\n24 Classic Brandy Cocktails You Have to Try""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-and-benedictine-recipe-759285

Choose whatever fruits look good at the market and pile them on.\nWhile this recipe is for a single serving, the measurements can easily be increased to serve more. Keep the ingredients in proportion, multiplying each for the number of servings needed. Mix it up in a pitcher and store in the refrigerator until it\'s time to serve. Add club soda and ice to the pitcher at the last minute or to the individual serving glasses.\nRecipe Variations\nThe fruit juice is where you can really play with this recipe. At some bars, you will find a ""bar punch mix"" used instead of individual juices. Pineapple juice is a favorite, though orange and passion fruit juices are common as well. This is also the perfect drink to use a bottled fruit juice blend, but make sure it includes at least one tropical fruit.\nThough the dark rum adds a richness to the background, a light rum will work just fine. Spiced and flavored rums can also give the drink a new twist.\nIf you want to skip the rum, you can make a nonalcoholic planter\'s punch that is quite tasty as well.\nInstead of grenadine, pour 1/2 ounce pomegranate juice and 1/4 ounce simple syrup. Lime juice works as well, though it changes the flavor. You can also use any other fruit syrup, such as strawberry, raspberry, or a tart sour mix.\nIf you like, substitute the club soda with ginger ale or a citrus soda.\nConsider adding 1/2 to 3/4 ounces of orange cura?ao or another orange liqueur, or finish it off with a few dashes of aromatic or orange bitters. You might even add a twist with favorite tiki cocktail ingredients like 1/2 ounce of orgeat syrup (to replace the grenadine) or a splash of pimento dram.\nHow Strong Is a Planter\'s Punch?\nIf you pour an 80-proof rum in this recipe, the alcohol content will be in the 14 percent ABV (28 proof) range. Adding club soda makes it even milder, just around 10 percent ABV (20 proof). Either way, it\'s a relatively light cocktail.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/planters-punch-recipe-759331

According to Harry Craddock\'s 1930 ""The Savoy Cocktail Book,"" it was made famous by New York newspaper columnist Karl K. Kitchen (1885?1935) and used Beefeater Gin.\nHow Strong Is a Bacardi Cocktail?\nThe rum dominates this cocktail and, though it may be sweet and delicious, it is a strong drink. Its alcohol content falls into the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range, making it slightly more potent than a shaken daiquiri.\nWhere Is Bacardi Rum From?\nBacardi Rum was founded in 1862 in Santiago de Cuba and by the 1930s they were producing rum in Puerto Rico and Mexico. During the Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro in the 1960s, Bacardi left Cuba entirely and for many years it was not sold in the country. The Puerto Rican location is the largest rum distillery in the world today. Bacardi Limited is one of the giants of the liquor industry. It owns many popular brands of alcohol, including Grey Goose Vodka, Patr?n Tequila, and Bombay Sapphire Gin.\nWhy Is Bacardi So Popular?\nLikely due to a combination of mass distribution and great marketing, Bacardi became a household name in rum during the 20th century. In A.S. Crockett\'s 1935 ""The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book,"" there are 17 cocktail recipes?including a collins, daisy, old-fashioned, and rickey?that have the Bacardi name. In classic bartending guides, it\'s not uncommon to find recipes that use Bacardi as a stand-in for rum. The rum has also had many devoted and well-known fans. During Prohibition, for example, many Americans ventured to Cuba to enjoy the adult beverages they couldn\'t legally drink in the U.S. Among them was the legendary writer, Ernest Hemingway. Famous for his love of rum?and daiquiris, in particular?he has his own cocktail, the Hemingway daiquiri. It\'s said that Bacardi was his preferred rum.\nWhat\'s the Law Regarding the Bacardi Cocktail?\nIn 1936, Bacardi filed a lawsuit against a bar because it was not serving the brand\'s rum when customers asked for it. The New York Supreme Court\'s ruling did not affect the Bacardi cocktail alone but stretches to any drink in which a customer calls out Bacardi by name. If you order a Bacardi mojito, the law says that the bartender should pour Bacardi.\nAre There More ""Bacardi"" Cocktails?\nCocktails such as the mojito, daiquiri, and Cuba libre have a connection to the Bacardi brand as well. Some stories attribute the rum to the original creation of these drinks, a scenario that is possible considering the rum\'s popularity. It was just as prevalent then as it today, and it\'s feasible that bartenders picked up a bottle of Bacardi when they first poured these now-classic drinks. Other signature cocktails from Bacardi include the commodore and dulce de leche.\nRum Cocktail Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bacardi-cocktail-recipe-759282

The mint julep has remained the drink to have while watching the Derby. There is also a new ""official"" julep recipe released every year that often includes additional flavors, and they\'re quite impressive.\nThat\'s not the case for the other two races. The official cocktails change regularly, and, oddly enough, they frequently keep the same name. It has happened with the black-eyed Susan and the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes\' drinks are no different.\nFor many years, the white carnation was the Belmont drink of choice. In 1998, Dale DeGroff created the Belmont breeze for the race, and it\'s a fabulously complex drink. The Belmont Jewel recipe above was published in 2011, although different premium bourbons are recommended as marketing and sponsorship changes. Feel free to make this recipe with any bourbon you like. You really can\'t go wrong with this drink.\nHow Strong Is the Belmont Jewel?\nThe strength of the Belmont Jewel is going to depend on the bourbon you pour. The difference is minimal, though the comparison is interesting. For instance, with 43.2 percent ABV bourbon, the cocktail mixes up to about 13 percent ABV (26 proof). When you pour a stronger 50 percent ABV bourbon, the drink is around 15 percent ABV (30 proof). Either way, the Belmont jewel is similar to a glass of wine.\nYour Complete Guide to Whiskey Styles']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/woodford-reserve-belmont-jewel-recipe-761402

Our recipe is one of the most traditional ratios for a French martini, though it's fun to play with the recipe to see which version you enjoy best:\nAccentuate the fruit flavor by pouring 2 ounces of pineapple juice with 1 ounce of vodka and 1/2 ounce of Chambord.\nMake a sweet cocktail by pouring 1 ounce each of vodka and Chambord and 2 ounces of pineapple juice.\nMake a drier version using gin. Until vodka really took over, some of the first French martinis were made with dry gin. You can find this version in numerous bartending guides through the mid-2000s. To make it drier, it's often preferred with 1/4 ounce of Chambord.\nReplace the Chambord with a different raspberry liqueur, but be sure to choose something of comparable quality. Chambord is made with raspberries, blackberries, and blackcurrants, and its complex flavor is hard to substitute altogether. Try using cr?me de Cassis, a liquor made with blackcurrants, also very bold in flavor although darker in appearance than the Chambord.\nWhy Is It Called a French Martini?\nDespite its name, this cocktail was created in the United States. The drink's French Chambord is what gives the cocktail its name, as Chambord?a black raspberry liqueur produced in France?is key to the preparation. This martini also propelled Chambord to the highest ranks of popular top-shelf liqueurs and for that reason, it was erroneously credited for many years as having been created for the brand's marketing campaign.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in some Prohibition-era bartending guides, the French martini refers to a 5:1 gin, French (dry) vermouth, olive, and lemon peel cocktail, much like a double-garnished, very dry martini.\nHow Strong Is the French Martini?\nThe alluring flavor of cocktails like the French martini can make it easy to forget that they're actually quite potent. When made with 80-proof vodka, the French martini has an alcohol content right around 19 percent ABV (38 proof). To put that into perspective, the average vodka martini is 56 proof and a vodka cranberry is about 28 proof.\nChampagne and Chambord""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/french-martini-cocktail-recipe-760080

Seal, shake well, and let infuse in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks (or up to 1 month), shaking the jar every day or two.\nThe day the infusion is complete, make a rich simple syrup: Bring the water to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium heat and stir in the sugar until completely dissolved and the syrup is clear. Reduce to a simmer. After 5 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and let cool completely.\nStrain the orange peels from the vodka using a fine-mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth.\nRinse out the infusion jar and use it to blend the orange liqueur by adding 3/4 cup of the simple syrup to the orange-infused vodka. Shake very well for at least 30 seconds. Taste the liqueur and add more syrup to sweeten to taste.\nTransfer the orange liqueur to a bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid and use in your favorite cocktail recipes.\nTips\nReadily available year-round, navel orange peels have a nice sweetness that offsets the bitter peel in this recipe. To reduce waste, peel the fruit then cut it in half and squeeze out the juice.\nA vegetable peeler is a quick and easy way to remove large strips of peel and avoid most of the white pith, which will add even more bitterness to the liqueur.\nFor consistent results, purchase dried bitter orange peel. It's sold in small bulk packages by retailers that specialize in dried botanicals, including several online shops.\nAvoid using the cheapest vodka for this recipe, particularly if you hope to replicate high-end liqueurs like Cointreau or Grand Marnier. While top-shelf is not required, it's best with a smooth vodka that you enjoy drinking straight or in mixed drinks.\nTo make a Grand Marnier substitute, replace one cup of vodka with brandy. Using tequila instead transforms this recipe into a liqueur that's similar to Patr?n Citr?nge.\nHow to Store\nAlcohol is a natural preservative, but sugar reduces a liqueur's shelf life. It's best to drink your homemade orange liqueur within six months and store it away from heat and direct light. Refrigeration is not required, and you may want to shake it before use. If you notice any crystalizing or off-flavors, make a new batch.\nHow Strong Is Homemade Orange Liqueur?\nWhen made with 80-proof vodka, the orange liqueur weighs around 28 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 56 proof). That's similar to the average triple sec and equivalent to a shaken margarita. Using a 100-proof vodka intensifies the flavor and yields a liqueur closer to Cointreau, at around 38 percent ABV (76 proof).\nWhat's the difference between triple sec, Grand Marnier, Cointreau, and orange liqueur?\nThere are several styles of orange liqueur. While they all have the same basic citrus taste and are suitable substitutes for each other in most instances, there are subtle differences. Cointreau is a premium brand of triple sec that's stronger, drier, and less sweet than most triple sec. Cura?ao is very similar and focuses on dried bitter orange peels. The majority of orange liqueurs use neutral spirits, which is why they're clear or have a slight orange color. Grand Marnier uses brandy, giving it an amber color and darker flavor profile.\nCan you drink orange liqueur by itself?\nOrange liqueur is most often used in cocktails and mixed drinks. A premium orange liqueur like Grand Marnier or Cointreau can be sipped straight. It's best on the rocks because as the ice melts, a little dilution softens the sweetness and flavor.\nLimoncello (Lemon Liqueur)""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/homemade-orange-liqueur-recipe-5216816

Enjoy!\nTips\nOne of the best ways to choose a good shandy beer is, to begin with, those light, refreshing beers that you enjoy most in the summer. Wheat beer and light lagers create the best shandy and are preferred. Pilsner is always a favorite shandy base as well. If you love a hoppy IPA, it is fine to use a lighter one with a shandy, but you will probably not use a dark beer or stout.\nJust as the quality of the beer is important, so is the quality of lemonade. You could use one of those popular lemonade mixes or purchase a pre-mixed bottle from the store, but the best lemonade is going to be made from scratch. Homemade lemonade is easy to make with fresh lemons, sugar, and water. It also produces a more refreshing lemonade with natural flavors, and you know exactly what is in it.\nSqueezing fresh juice is probably the one step that keeps people from enjoying fresh lemonade, but that is easy as well. Maybe you can even get the kids to help and reward them with an afternoon lemonade party, saving your portion for a shandy, of course.\nRecipe Variation\nBesides a slice of lemon, you might experiment with adding other fruit to your shandy. A dollop of strawberry syrup or lilac simple syrup can add an additional element. You can play with what you have on hand.\n\nBottled Shandy Beers\nIt has been quite popular in recent years for brewers to release a summer shandy or radler beer. Many of these retain the lemon flavor of the shandy recipe, though a few opt for grapefruit or other citrus fruits and some add ginger for a nice contrast. Shandy beers tend to be lighter in alcohol as well, so these are good daytime sipping during the summer months. You can give them a try to see if they match your own mixed ones at home.\nHow Strong is a Shandy?\nSince a shandy is half beer and half lemonade, it will have half the alcohol by volume (ABV) of whatever beer you choose to use.\n\nLemon Summer Shandy']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-make-a-shandy-353187

The lychee has a membranous feel and they're hollow so they're a little slippery to work with when wet. It's good to let them dry out for at least 30 minutes.\nRinse the blueberries and pick out a few that will fit into the hole of the lychee.\nCanned lychees have a hole in both ends; choose the easiest one to work with when creating the eyeball innards. Using a small, flat tool, carefully fill the hollow lychee with preserves, taking care not to tear the delicate white flesh.\nGently insert one blueberry into the hole, allowing the preserves to ooze out of the sides. Be careful not to go too far or your berry will be lost.\nOnce the berry is in place, use a toothpick to spread the preserves over the lychee, painting the veins of an eyeball. Make any adjustments to the berry and preserves until you get the look you want.\nGently poke a cocktail skewer into the back of the eyeball. Set the eyeball aside and continue building as many as you need.\nGarnish drinks by resting the skewer on the glass rim. Serve and enjoy!\nWhat Are the Best Tools to Fill the Lychee?\nThe lychee flesh is delicate, so you'll need a small tool to fill it. The best options are the scoop end of a seafood fork and a small and inexpensive artist's palette knife (available at craft and art stores). Tiny knives and spoons will work, as will a small icing spatula. In a pinch, use the smallest spoon you have to scoop the filling into the lychee, then poke it into the fruit with a skewer, chopstick, or toothpick.\nHow Far in Advance Can the Lychee Eyeballs Be Made?\nThis is not a garnish that you can prepare too early. After a few hours, the white lychee will soak up the preserves, turning the flesh purple?it's a gruesome effect on its own but not quite as neat. To preserve the look, place them in a single layer in the freezer for no more than 1 day. The eyeballs can also be frozen into ice cube trays that will float in drinks (they don't float on their own). Another (considerably cleaner) option is to skip the preserves and simply fit blueberries into the lychee; cover them in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.\nTips\nLychee is a popular little fruit in Asian cuisine and it should be easy to find at your local international food market. Supermarkets with a good Asian food selection may have them and, of course, they're available online.\nWhile you can find the fresh fruit, it's important to peel and pit the lychee carefully so the flesh remains intact you have a small hole on each end. Canned lychee is much easier to work with for this project.\nPick up a can or two more than you think you will need. The fruit is sometimes damaged in the canning process and you'll have extra available if any tear.\nThe red fruit preserves or jam create the bloody vein part of the eyeball. Any red fruit will work; red raspberry has a dark red look, and strawberry and cherry are good choices, too.\nMaking this garnish is pretty messy; have a wet washcloth nearby to wipe your hands.\nHalloween Drinks & Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/halloween-lychee-eyeballs-5073596

If you have a standard syrup made with equal parts of sugar and water, pour the full 3/4 ounce.\nFresh lemon juice is the key to a great whiskey sour. Bottled lemon juices are either too sweet or too tart and will significantly affect the quality of your drink.\nEvery new style or brand of whiskey you choose will give the cocktail a unique flavor profile. Most drinkers prefer bourbon, though a good rye whiskey makes an excellent sour as well.\nAs you switch from one whiskey to another, you may need to adjust the sweet and sour elements.\nAdd an Egg White\nA traditional recipe for whiskey sours includes an egg white. It tends to tame the tartness and make the drink a bit smoother. The use of raw egg is a matter of personal choice, though. Many drinkers pass on the ingredient because there is a potential for salmonella, while others believe that the risks are minimal.\nWhen using egg, dry shake all of the ingredients without ice, then add ice and shake for at least 30 seconds to ensure it\'s properly mixed. It\'s also generally preferred to serve the drink on the rocks.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.\nRecipe Variations\nSour mix (sometimes called sweet and sour mix) is a popular shortcut that combines the sweet and sour components into one mixer. It is an easy option, and many sour recipes suggest it, although you lose control of the final taste. If you opt for this, make a fresh sour mix for the best flavor.\nWhen you add soda to this drink (or any sour), you have a collins cocktail. The whiskey version is John Collins.\nIf you choose Scotch whisky, you have a scotch sour, which often skips the sweetener entirely.\nThe Frisco sour is a popular variation. B?n?dictine is the sweetener, with both lemon and lime for the sour. \nThe Canadian sour picks up the citrus aspect when using Canadian whisky.\nThe old thyme sour is a complex variation, pairing Irish whiskey with elderberry liqueur, Green Chartreuse, cinnamon, and thyme.\nA variety of distilled spirits shine in the sour formula. Switch from whiskey to gin, rum, tequila, or vodka, and adjust the sweet and sour to suit the new liquor and your taste.\nFor brandy, flavored brandies like apricot are popular in sours. The pisco sour is another brandy version that almost always includes the egg white.\nLiqueurs have potential as well, and it\'s often best to reduce or eliminate the sweetener because they\'re already sweetened. The most popular ones for sour drinks are amaretto, citrus liqueur, coffee liqueur, and melon liqueur.\nHistory of the Whiskey Sour\nThe whiskey sour made its official debut in Jerry Thomas\' 1862 ""The Bon Vivant\'s Companion"" (or ""How to Mix Drinks""), which was the first published bartending guide. However, you can trace the cocktail\'s roots to a century before that.\nIn general, sour drinks were initially created to fight off scurvy among British Navy sailors during the 1700s. Most often, this meant adding lime to the rum rations (inspiring drinks like the Navy grog). Not only did it ward off disease, the rum or gin (and sometimes whiskey) helped preserve the perishable fruit juice on long voyages.\nFrom there, the addition of a little sugar enhanced the citrus-liquor combination. The result was a more drinkable and very tasty beverage. These eventually became known as the sour family of drinks, which have remained popular; the whiskey sour remains the most notable.\nHow Strong Is a Whiskey Sour?\nAssuming that you pour an 80-proof whiskey into a whiskey sour, it is a relatively mild drink. Its alcohol content falls in the range of 14 percent alcohol by volume (28 proof). That\'s about half the strength of a Manhattan and similar to a glass of wine.\nIs There a Certain Order for Pouring Cocktail Ingredients?']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiskey-sour-recipe-761273

Stir very well to ensure that all of the sugar is dissolved.\nIf not serving right away, place it in the fridge. Add the ginger ale or club soda just before serving so the sangria retains its sparkle. Serve cold and enjoy.\nQuick Sangria and Marinated Sangria\nIf you need a sangria ASAP, and your wine is not chilled, prepare the sangria but serve it over lots of ice.\nHowever, if you have the time, we recommend preparing the sangria?minus any bubbly elements?the night before to allow the flavors to meld. This makes an even tastier drink.\nMake Your Own Favorite Sangria\nSangrias are very forgiving. To find a recipe that suits your palate best:\nChoose a wine: Use a good quality sauvignon blanc, chardonnay, riesling, albari?o, gew?rztraminer, viognier, or pinot gris.\nPick the fruits: The citrus fruits included in the recipe are essential to creating a basic sangria. But add to the flavor with any other types of fruits. In total, you should need only 1 or 2 cups of additional fruit. Two small mangoes, one small apple, one small papaya, or one small pineapple should give you plenty of fruit to work with. A small container each of strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries are enough for a berry version.\nAdjust the sweetness: For a drier sangria, add less sugar and/or use more club soda. For a sweeter sangria, add the sugar as instructed and use ginger ale or lemon-lime soda instead.\nAdd some booze: Many sangria recipes include a small amount of liquor along with the wine. We recommend brandy, a flavorful fortified wine that's a classic ingredient in sangria, but other versions use orange liqueur, like Grand Marnier or Cointreau, or elderflower liqueur.\nHow Strong Is Sangria?\nSangria is a relatively low-alcohol drink, making it nice for daytime gatherings and summer parties. Even with the brandy included, sangria tends to weigh in at between 5 to 10 percent ABV?lighter than a glass of wine.\nThe Best Party Sangria""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/simple-white-wine-sangria-recipe-3511043

Keep the ingredients in proportion and multiply it by the number of servings you need. You can even mix the liquors in a pitcher, then top the individual glasses with soda to ensure your guests get the most refreshing drink possible.\nYou can add extra flavor to the melon patch by infusing your own vodka with fruit or choosing one of the many flavored vodkas on the market. Double up on the melon flavor with a melon vodka or try a complementary flavor like citrus, strawberry, or vanilla vodkas.\nHow Strong Is a Melon Patch?\nThe volume of club soda you pour may vary, depending on the size of your glass. That will ultimately affect the alcohol content of the melon patch. Yet, it's always going to be a mild cocktail that weighs in somewhere around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). That's perfectly normal for?if not slightly higher than?a highball cocktail.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/melon-patch-recipe-759320

Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nThe blue margarita is on the tart side. If you want to sweeten it up, combine 1 1/2 ounces tequila, 3/4 ounce each of blue cura?ao and lime juice, and 1/4 ounce of 2:1 simple syrup.\n\nThis recipe creates a blue margarita that is served over the ice used in the shaker. That\'s not always the best approach because the ice in your drink is already broken down, so it dilutes faster. It works well for the blue margarita, but there are other ways to serve this (or any) margarita:\nOver fresh ice: Strain the drink into your glass over fresh ice so the ice will not melt as quickly.\nAs an ""up"" drink: Strain the drink directly into a chilled cocktail or margarita glass with no ice.\nIn a rocks glass: Stemware is not required, so go the casual route and serve it in your favorite lowball glass on the rocks.\nBlend it up: Toss all of the ingredients into a blender with about 1 cup of ice (5 to 6 cubes) and blend until smooth.\nWhy Is Cura?ao Blue?\nQuite simply, blue cura?ao has its color because at some point in its origin?almost certainly by the early 1900s?makers decided to add color to it. The artificial color does not affect its taste; in fact, cura?ao comes in other colors like orange, red, and green.\nWhat Is Blue Cura?ao Syrup?\nThe name blue cura?ao is also used with nonalcoholic syrups. Monin and Finest Call are two syrup brands that produce it; Monin is the top choice of the pair. These are not liqueurs but blue-colored, orange-flavored syrups often found in the mixer section at the liquor store. They\'re useful for creating blue mocktails and for those times when you want to cut some of the alcohol out of your cocktails.\nDoes Blue Cura?ao Go Bad?\nYes, eventually, but it\'ll last months or even years if stored properly. You want to store all liqueurs in a cool, dark place?refrigeration is not necessary, but the back of a cabinet is ideal. Keep in mind that liqueurs that have higher sugar content will tend to degrade more quickly, and blue cura?ao nonalcoholic syrup will have a shorter shelf life than the liqueur.\nWhat Is Blue Cura?ao vs. Triple Sec vs. Cointreau?\nThere is no legal differentiation between blue cura?ao and triple sec, and Cointreau is just one brand of triple sec. All are orange liqueurs. Cura?ao can come in a variety of colors, of which blue is one. Triple sec is traditionally clear. While cura?ao is said to originate from the Dutch Caribbean island of the same name, triple sec has its origins in France. (Triple sec literally translates to ""triple dry,"" and it is indeed drier, or less sweet, than cura?ao.) Cura?ao is traditionally made from one very specific type of bitter orange, the laraha orange, which grows on the island of Cura?ao; however, there is no legal requirement that this needs to be the case for a product to be called cura?ao.\nHow Strong Is the Blue Margarita?\nThis blue margarita is made primarily of alcohol and, despite its alluring color, it is not a light drink. When made with 80-proof tequila and 60-proof cura?ao, its alcohol content falls in the 23 percent ABV (46 proof) range. That\'s about half the strength of a straight shot of tequila, so it\'s best to take it easy with this cocktail.\nBlue Margarita']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blue-margarita-recipe-760849

This allows for zero cleanups, zero waiting for it to cool, and zero chance of sustaining second-degree burns.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThough the recipe recommends Bombay, any London dry or juniper-forward gin will work just fine in this cocktail. You will find it best with a premium gin, though, so don't be too cheap at the liquor store.\nWith all the fresh ingredients, be sure to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice, too. The average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces, so you'll have more than enough for a few drinks.\nSimple syrup is easy to make at home and it's much more economical to DIY it than buy premade syrup. You'll use it all the time in cocktails and all you need is sugar and water, so there's really no excuse not to make it.\nWhen you bring mint home (or cut it from your garden), place the stems in a vase of water to keep it fresh. It's a simple trick and doubles as a fragrant bouquet in the kitchen.\nFor the ginger, you'll find it best to cut slices that about 1/8-inch thick. This will give you enough flesh to muddle and produce a nice amount of extracted juice.\nRecipe Variations\nIf either your mint or ginger is starting to go bad, preserve the flavor and incorporate them into a simple syrup, then use that to make the cocktail. Ginger simple syrup requires about 1 cup of the sliced root; mint syrup is best with about 1/2 cup of fresh leaves. You could even combine the two ingredients for a ginger-mint syrup.\nAny light soda will work just as well as club soda in the eye candy recipe. Consider using ginger ale or any citrus soda and add more than a splash if you want it more effervescent.\nHow Strong Is an Eye Candy Cocktail?\nThe eye candy is a nice, casual sipper with an alcohol content that's average for this style of drink. When mixed up with the recommended brands, it should come out to around 20 percent ABV (40 proof), or about double the average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/eye-candy-cocktail-recipe-760048

At this point, the melon has absorbed all that it can.\nAllow the vodka and melon to rest refrigerated for 12 to 24 hours. The vodka will slowly filter into the watermelon's flesh as it rests.

Others pour less liquor, and some drinkers prefer lime juice over lemon.\nFor a simple twist, pour 1/2 ounce of a top-shelf triple sec rather than simple syrup. It acts as the drink\'s sweetener and adds a layer of citrus. Likewise, pour an elderflower liqueur for a floral spin.\nA staple at Arnaud\'s, the famous New Orleans restaurant, this French 75 recipe was designed specifically for cognac. It accommodates the darker spirit by reducing the citrus: Mix 1 ounce of cognac, 1/4 ounce each of fresh lemon juice and simple syrup, and 4 ounces Champagne.\nIn the French 76, vodka is the spirit of choice and simply replaces gin in the French 75 recipe. There are many variations on it as well, with some adding grenadine for a blush pink color.\nThe French 95 is for whiskey drinkers.

The Scottish owner of Harry\'s New York Bar in Paris and author of numerous 1920s bartending guides is known for creating many great drinks.

The best alternative is Gran Gala, which is made with Italian brandy.\nWhen you switch from Grand Marnier to amaretto, you\'re drinking a French Connection.

Serve and enjoy.\nWhat\'s the Right Proportions for a Rum and Coke?\nWhere the rum and Coke often goes bad is the ratio of the two ingredients. It is such an easy drink that bartenders?pro and amateur alike?typically dismiss the need for a balance of flavors. This results in a drink that is either ""burnt"" with alcohol or too sweet with soda.\nThe problem comes to light when drinkers try to ""fix"" a bad rum and Coke. All too often, they feel that they didn\'t pour enough rum because they can\'t taste it, so they add another shot. Now they have a double shot of rum and, unless another splash of Coke is added, the drink is too strong. This is great if you want to get drunk, but not so good if you want to taste a good drink.\n\nWhat are the best proportions for a rum and Coke? Typically, most drinkers will find a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 to have the best flavor and much of that will depend on the rum you choose.\nTips\nThe 1:2 pour creates a classically styled rum and Coke. To make this in the average 10-ounce highball glass, pour 2 ounces of rum and 4 ounces of Coke.\nThe 1:3 pour is often preferred by modern drinkers because we tend to like drinks a little sweeter. This version would use 2 ounces of rum with 6 ounces of Coke.\nDon\'t worry that either of those pours will not fill the 10-ounce glass. You should have already filled your glass with ice, which will take up the rest of the volume; consider ice to be the rum and Coke\'s third ingredient.\nIt is tempting to pour any old rum that is on the rail or well into a rum and Coke. The theory is that this is too simple of a drink and should not be used to waste a perfectly good shot of booze, so people tend to use the cheap stuff. Do yourself a favor and pour a rum you wouldn\'t mind drinking straight.\nWhite rums are the most popular base for rum and Coke, though you might also really enjoy it with an aged rum.\nWe recommend putting the rum in the freezer for ultimate chill?that way the ice will melt slower.\nRecipe Variations\nBy rights, the rum and Coke is made with Coca-Cola, and this is what the bartender will give you at the bar. Some drinkers prefer Pepsi because it is a softer cola, and that is perfectly fine. Be sure to order a ""rum and Pepsi"" at the bar if this is your preference.\nYou will notice a big difference between the Coke sold in the U.S. and the soda meant for other markets in the world that use real sugar. These make the Coke made with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) pale in comparison. The demand for real-sugar Coke has made it easier to find in the U.S., so if you spot it, stock up.\nOther colas, particularly those designed specifically as mixers for cocktails (e.g., Q Kola, Fever-Tree Madagascan Cola, and Fenitmans Curiosity Cola), will improve this drink even more. Give them a try, especially if you\'re trying to avoid HFCS.\nAdding the juice from a lime will create a drink called the Cuba libre.\nHow Strong Is a Rum and Coke?\nDespite its reputation, the properly poured rum and Coke is a surprisingly light drink because the cola and ice make up most of the drink\'s volume. With an 80-proof rum, the 1:2 rum and Coke weighs in at 12 percent ABV (24 proof), and the 1:3 is a little lighter at 9.5 percent ABV (19 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rum-and-coke-recipe-760560

Muddle well to break up the berries and dissolve the sugar. Tear the mint leaves while adding them to the glass and muddle gently to release the mint's essence.\nAdd the rum, and stir well.\nFill the glass with ice cubes and top with club soda.\nGarnish with a few blueberries, a sprig of mint, and a lime slice. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you don't have a muddler, a large spoon is a good alternative. Blueberries can stain porous materials, so you might not want to use a wooden muddler or spoon. If you do, rinse it off right away.\nSome people prefer to drink mojitos without mint and fruit in the glass. To do this, mix the fruits and rum in a cocktail shaker or mixing glass, then strain it into the serving glass and finish it with ice and soda.\nLight rum is often used in mojitos because it has a relatively transparent taste that lets the lime and mint take center stage. Complement those fresh flavors with a mid-range or top-shelf rum that you would drink on its own.\nMojito Pitcher Recipe\nFor a pitcher of blueberry mojitos, increase the ingredients in proportion to the number of desired servings. Mix the muddled ingredients in a large glass, then transfer to a pitcher, stir in the rum, and keep chilled. Add chilled club soda just before serving and pour into ice-filled glasses.\n\nRecipe Variations\nThis mojito is an excellent use for frozen blueberries. Let them thaw partially so they're easy to muddle, and use about 1/4 cup per drink.\nPreserve the taste of fresh mint before it wilts by making a mint simple syrup. Replace the recipe's mint and sugar with about 1/2 ounce of the syrup, adjusting to taste.\nPlain simple syrup is a good alternative to superfine sugar; add about 1/2 ounce to the muddle.\nMake a nonalcoholic blueberry mojito by skipping the rum. Add more club soda, switch to your favorite light soda (ginger ale is excellent), or substitute the rum and lime juice with limeade.\n\nHow Strong Is a Blueberry Mojito?\nMojitos have a moderate amount of alcohol because the nonalcoholic mixers outweigh the rum. When made with an 80-proof rum, the blueberry mojito mixes up to about 11 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 22 proof). That's similar to drinking a glass of wine.\nDo You Shake a Mojito?\nMojitos are typically not shaken. The drink's various flavors are married by muddling and stirring, and the soda and ice soften the taste with a perfect amount of dilution. Some people prefer to give the mojito a quick shake, particularly if they enjoy it strained. When doing so, shake everything except the soda and strain the cocktail over fresh ice because the shaker ice will melt more quickly in the glass.\nWhat Alcohol Is Best for Mojitos?\nWhile light rum is traditional for mojitos, you have other options. Aged rum adds a nice depth, and mango rum is a fantastic choice for the blueberry mojito (the two fruits are amazing together). If rum isn't your liquor of choice, vodka is a good substitute.\nRaspberry Mojito""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/blueberry-mojito-recipe-5189262

Garnish with a lemon wedge. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo make ginger sugar, combine 1 part white granulated sugar with 1/2 part ground ginger.

The other option is to add ice to the pitcher.\nDon't mix it up too early or you will lose some of the effervescence from the beers. You can also hold the beer, then top each glass with freshly tapped beer.\nYou will need two whole lemons to get 3 1/2 ounces of fresh-squeezed juice.\nRecipe Variations\nMake as much or as little of this drink as you need. Simply keep the ingredients in proportion: 1/2 part each cranberry juice and ginger beer to 1 part beer. For a single drink, a squeeze of juice from a lemon wedge is perfect.\nGive the shandy a kick by adding a shot (1 1/2 ounces) of whiskey or vodka to each glass.\nToss a couple of cinnamon sticks into the pitcher and let the flavor infuse into the drink for a few minutes to add a little extra spice. Cinnamon can also be added to the individual glasses.\nHow Strong Is a Cranberry Ginger Shandy?\nThis is one of the lightest mixed drinks you can make because you're essentially cutting the beer's strength in half. The lemon juice is a factor, too, so the alcohol content ends up as a very mild 2.3 percent ABV.

The maesil, or prunus mume, are native to southern China; they were later introduced throughout Asia. In the West, the fruit might be called the ¡°Chinese plum¡± or the ¡°Japanese apricot¡±, and in Japan, they are called ume. They are more closely related to the apricot than the plum.\nDifferent plum wines are popular through Asia, and Korea\'s version is sweet and a little bit tart. Maesil Ju can be enjoyed chilled after a meal or with snacks or meals. These green apricots can be made into tea or juice and pickled or preserved as condiments or snacks.\nThe maesil (green plum or green apricot) fruit has been used as medicine for centuries in Korea. The ""Dongeu bogam,\'\' an ancient Korean medicine text, notes the use of the maesil in Korea. It was used to treat blood disorders, dehydration, digestive problems, heart problems, and other ailments. Today, the maesil is used in drinks, in food and as part of Korean traditional medicine.\nWhat Is Honey?']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/korean-plum-wine-maesil-ju-recipe-2118537

As with all warm cocktails, it's best when served in a warm glass. If you use the microwave, the job is already done for you. Should you opt for the stovetop method, pour hot water (like that from your teapot) into the glass while warming up the ginger beer. Dump the water out before building your drink.\nMake It in the Microwave\nGather the ingredients.\nPour the vodka and ginger beer into an Irish coffee glass or mug.\nMicrowave for 10 to 20 seconds.\nAdd a cinnamon stick.\nServe and enjoy.\nMake It on the Stovetop\nIn a small saucepan, heat the ginger beer gently for a few minutes. It should reach a very low simmer, but not a boil.\nPour the vodka into a warmed Irish coffee glass or mug, then top with the warm ginger beer.\nDrop a cinnamon stick into the glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nPear Vodka Options\nPear vodka is a great addition to any modern bar and you have a few options for obtaining it for your Christmas mule.\nCommercially, you will find pear vodka from a number of the biggest brands in the vodka market. Among the top recommendations are Grey Goose La Poire, Absolut Pears, and Smirnoff Pear. If you want to seek out a lesser-known and equally impressive pear-flavored vodka, look for Veil, Wild Roots or Xero.\nAnother option that is a little more involved (but also a little more fun) is to make your own pear vodka. It's as easy as any other vodka infusion and should take about one week to reach an optimum flavor.\nHow Strong Is the Christmas Mule?\nGinger beer is nonalcoholic, so the vodka is the only alcohol in the Christmas mule. That means that this is a surprisingly light drink and that adds to its appeal as a casual, soothing winter sipper. On average, you can expect the drink to weigh in around 9 percent ABV (18 proof), which is about the same as the average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/christmas-mule-cocktail-recipe-4149594

Some unique garnishes to add to your martini can include lemongrass spears, a sprig of rosemary or mint, Sriracha salt rim (if you really want to bring the heat), a lollipop in a complementary flavor, and herbed or fruit ice cubes.\nUnique ice cubes: Make herbed or fruit ice cubes by adding mint, parsley, basil, or other herbs or chunks of fresh fruit to the water in ice cube tray. Freeze as usual.\nRecipe Variations\nOther teas you can use: If you do not have hibiscus tea, you can use a simple black tea bag, chamomile, or green tea bag.\nAdd herbs: In addition to tea, herbs such as lavender, rosemary, and lemon balm are being used to infuse some flavor into martinis. Take a traditional martini recipe and simply muddle mint, minced lemon balm, or garnish with lavender and you dial up the class (and the glass) of a martini cocktail recipe. \nAdd heat with spices: Spices are being added to martinis to give the wow factor.

The bowl of the bar spoon is thinner, smaller, and lighter weight than a normal spoon so it can fit inside most shot glasses (except the really skinny ones). Plus, the long, thin handle makes it easier to control the spoon's movement. If you don't own one, it's a useful tool to add to your bar.\nWhen you use a speed pourer on the bottle of Irish cream, you may be able to eliminate the need for a spoon. Carefully and slowly pour the top layer, pointing the tip of the speed pourer directly onto the interior of the glass and it should create a layer.\nIf you plan ahead, stick the two bottles of liquor in the refrigerator for a few hours for a nice chill. You can speed it up by popping them in the freezer. Don't worry about the liqueurs freezing because the average freezer doesn't get cold enough. Just don't forget them there or they may become slushie (a bigger concern with the Irish cream; Midori will warm up just fine).\nHow Strong Is an Irish Frog Shot?\nThere is no dilution in a layered shot, so you're drinking the average of the two liqueurs combined. Since both of these are around 20 percent ABV (40 proof), the shooter's alcohol content will be that as well. It's not the strongest shot you can make, though it is half of a straight shot of tequila or whiskey and a few rounds will add up quickly.\nRecipe Variation\nThis shooter is very similar to a fruity Irishman. It's a play on the more popular nutty Irishman, though it uses the same ingredients as the Irish frog. It does concentrate more on the Irish cream, and to make it, you'll shake 2 parts Irish cream with 1 part Midori, then strain it into a shot glass. For the average shot glass, pour 1 ounce of Irish cream and 1/2 ounce of Midori.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/irish-frog-shooter-759700

The most common that fans of this drink seem to do is put their bottles of gin and vermouth in the refrigerator or even the freezer. That way the alcohols stay cold and there's no dilution when mixing it with the ice.\nHow Strong Is the In and Out Martini?\nAs with any cocktail that is made entirely of liquor, this is not a light drink. In fact, it is stronger than the dry martini because there's very little vermouth in it to weigh down the gin. If we make the In and Out Martini with the average 80-proof gin, it would have an alcohol content of around 34 percent ABV (68 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTop-shelf gin is the way to go with this cocktail. It relies heavily on that single ingredient and lays the foundation for the best-tasting drink.\nWhen it comes to sweet vermouth, ensure that it's fresh. If you don't mix with it often, that open bottle in your bar may be stale. Its shelf life is just 3 months once oxygen hits the fortified wine, so replacing old bottles is a good idea.\nFor the orange liqueur, triple sec and cura?ao will not do. This drink deserves a brandy-based, sweet orange that can only come from Grand Marnier or GranGala.\nThe lemon juice should not be an afterthought. Fresh-squeezed juice is the final touch for a great leap year. Since the average lemon yields 1 3/4 ounces, you can easily make more than a few drinks with one piece of fruit.\nTo maximize your fruit usage, cut the lemon twist before cutting the lemon open. You can then use that same piece of fruit for its juice.\nRecipe Variations\nThere are a few similar drinks within the gin martini lexicon that are worth mixing up and comparing to the leap year.\nThe gin and it is a simplified version that uses gin and sweet vermouth alone.\nThe Emerson cocktail is a lesser-known variation on the popular Martinez (the gin martini's predecessor). Those two drinks opt for maraschino rather than an orange liqueur, though the Emerson includes the same lemon juice enhancement as the leap year.\nHow Strong Is a Leap Year Cocktail?\nMartinis are rarely light drinks and the leap year follows that pattern. This shouldn't come as a surprise because the majority of the cocktail is made of alcoholic ingredients. Though it will vary slightly, this cocktail's alcohol content will be in the 29 percent ABV (58 proof) range.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/leap-year-cocktail-recipe-760098

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a well-chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a sprig of lavender. Serve and enjoy.\nLavender Simple Syrup\nThe lavender simple syrup is very easy to make at home. All you need is sugar, water, and lavender flowers. It will take just about 10 minutes of your time and is best when the herb is left to steep in the syrup for at least 1 hour.\nOnce you try it, this flavored syrup may become a staple in your bar. It can be used to give a variety of cocktails and mocktails an herbal twist. Try it in recipes like the lavender collins, lavender lemon drop, and trophy margarita. You can even use it to create a homemade lavender soda; simply top 2 ounces of the syrup with club soda or seltzer.\nChoose Your Spirits\nNo matter the flavor, any martini deserves the best liquor in your bar. For the best cocktail, pour your favorite premium gin. There are many great brands available and, since each gin uses a different botanical recipe, each will play off the lavender in different ways. It's a fantastic recipe to explore herbal flavor pairings.\nIf you go with vodka, choose a top-shelf brand as well. The vodka version is even more transparent, and a clean-tasting, smooth vodka will make a big difference. Try it with a potato vodka rather than one with a grain base. These tend to be smoother and slightly oily, ideal for accenting the lavender.\nHow Strong Is the Lavender Martini?\nDespite their elegant appearance, martinis are typically not weak drinks. The lavender martini is no exception. When made with an 80-proof gin, the alcohol content will be around 25 percent ABV (50 proof).

Once the syrup is cool, strain out any banana chunks and you are ready to go. Add a second banana for a more intense flavor.\nIf you want to take the easy route, a few syrup companies offer banana syrup. Look for it from brands like Amoretti and Torani.\nBanana dust is created by caramelizing white granulated sugar with the banana syrup and Sailor Jerry Rum. To make it, combine 1 cup sugar and 1/4 cup each of syrup and rum in a saucepan. Stir constantly as the sugar dissolves and bring to a boil, then stop stirring. Reduce to a simmer for about 8 to 10 minutes?unlike regular caramelized sugar that\'s made with water, the color is not an indicator of doneness, so use a candy thermometer with the goal of reaching the hard-crack stage of about 300 F. Before it cools, pour the caramel onto a foil-lined pan that\'s greased and allow it to harden. Break the hard banana candy into small chunks and transform it into ""dust"" in a food processor.\nRecipe Variation\nAs an easier alternative to banana dust, place a handful of dried banana pieces in a food processor and blend until you\'re left with the finest particles possible. This can then be mixed with white or raw sugar at a ratio of 1 part banana to 2 parts sugar until you get a uniform color. Add a little spice if you like, such as ground cinnamon and nutmeg.\nHow Strong Is a Banana Hammock?\nSailor Jerry is bottled at 92 proof, which is why it\'s such a flavorful spiced rum. Since it\'s the only alcohol in the banana hammock, the drink shakes up to be surprisingly gentle. On average, its alcohol content should fall somewhere around 20 percent ABV (40 proof), so it\'s similar to drinking a shaken strawberry daiquiri.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/banana-hammock-cocktail-recipe-760447

Blend quickly to chop and combine.\nAdd the rum, apple juice, and sugar and blend until smooth and well-mixed.\nPour the mix equally into two highball glasses.\nGarnish each with an apple fan. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nBe sure to rinse all the fruit first. Peel the peaches and ginger if you prefer; strawberries should have the green stem removed; scoop out the flesh and seeds of passion fruit.\nFor the rum, it's not necessary to pour your best bottle in this drink because of all the bold flavors. A good, smooth white rum that you'd use in a drink like the strawberry daiquiri will do just fine.\nCloudy apple juice is filtered only once. If you cannot find it at the store, regular apple juice or apple cider will work.\nTo create an apple fan garnish, cut a few thin slices from a half or whole apple (depending on the size of your glass and the fruit). Then fan them out so they're overlapping slightly and rest them upright along the side of the glass. Use a skewer to hold them in place if needed.\nWhen you cut the apples for the garnish, dunk them in lemon juice immediately. This will halt the oxidation process that turns the fruit's flesh brown and make a better-looking garnish.\nRecipe Variation\nAs a substitute for fresh passion fruit (which isn't always available), use passion fruit juice or puree. About 2 ounces of either should be perfect for this recipe.\nHow Strong Is a May Day Cocktail?\nEstimating the alcohol content of a drink like this is difficult because all of the fruits are variable. Yet, the May Day cocktail is going to generally be a very light drink. On average, it should weigh in somewhere around 6 percent ABV (12 proof) when made with an 80-proof rum.

The small seeds will make it through your strainer and end up floating in your margarita.\nIf a whole jalape?o is too spicy for your taste, use just a couple slices rather than an entire pepper.

Drinking overly spicy things is much different than eating them! Save your taste buds so you can enjoy your cocktails.\nIf you like, rim the glass with salt or, for a little extra heat, a blend of salt and chili powder.\nHow Strong Is a Jalape?o Margarita?\nAs with most nonblended margaritas, this is going to be a pretty potent drink, which is why it\'s just over 3 ounces. When made with 80-proof tequila, the alcohol content will end up in the 22 percent ABV (44 proof) range.

This recipe uses a blood orange habanero puree and mole negro to put a very different spin on the margarita.\nThe habanero martini is a fun alternative to margaritas.

It's also one of the best herbal teas (technically called a tisane) for a refreshing iced tea, which is why it works so well in this cocktail.\nAll you really need is the dried herb. It's an easy plant to grow in the garden and many stores stock it as a prepared tea bag or a loose-leaf tea as well.\nThe standard brewing time for lemon verbena is 5 to 7 minutes in near-boiling water. After straining the whole leaves or removing the tea bag, place it in the refrigerator to cool before mixing your drinks.\nTip\nLemon verbena can also be used in a tea blend and it's a fantastic way to add a lemony background to nearly any tea. Feel free to brew it along with your favorite green or black teas, it's lovely with lavender, and you'll find it makes a mint tea even more refreshing. Any of these variations can be mixed into the Jalisco high tea.\nRecipe Variation\nThe Jalisco high tea is a fabulous option for a pitcher drink if you're hosting a small party. It's great for cookouts on the patio or a summer brunch and can be increased to as large of a batch as you need.\nWhen doing so, consider ramping up the tea portion in relation to the other ingredients. Retaining equal portions of tea and tequila could have you pouring almost a full bottle of tequila.\n\nFor a 60-ounce pitcher, pour the following: 20 ounces (2 1/2 cups) tequila, 25 ounces (3 1/8 cups) lemon verbena tea, 2 1/2 ounces Cherry Heering, 5 ounces simple syrup, and 1 ounce lime juice. Adjust the liqueur, lime, and syrup to suit your taste. This should leave enough room to add ice right before you serve it.\n\nIf you want to turn it into a sparkling tea, simply add a little club soda or any other clear, lightly flavored soda to replace a portion of the tea. Five ounces would be a great place to begin.\nHow Strong Is a Jalisco High Tea?\nThe Jalisco high tea is a delightfully mild cocktail. On average, the alcohol content will be just 15 percent ABV (30 proof), and it will get lighter if you decide to add more tea. This is more in line with the average glass of wine, which is perfect for casual drinking and won't leave your guests tipsy.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jalisco-high-tea-recipe-760833

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you're unsure about adding the salt rim (it's a tricky decision with this particular margarita), there's no need to make a full commitment: Rim only half the glass. This allows you to alternate sips between salt and no salt to see which you like best.\nThis cocktail has a very delicate balance of flavors. Be sure to measure the ingredients to ensure you get a taste of it as it was intended. After that first drink, you might find that you want a little more Drambuie or less lime. Take note and make adjustments to suit your personal taste.\nHow Strong Is a Highland Margarita?\nThe three liquors in this margarita are each bottled at 80 proof, which would indicate that the cocktail's going to be strong. The factor that affects the recipe's actual alcohol content is the lime juice; a single lime can yield between 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce of juice. Using the larger volume, the margarita mixes up to about 27 percent ABV (54 proof) and with less juice, it will be even stronger. This is not unusual for shaken margaritas, but it is one of the more potent options and something to keep in mind before mixing up another round.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/highland-margarita-recipe-760827

Serve and enjoy.\nAn Inspiration for Variations\nJust like the whiskey sour, you can find inspiration in the New England sour to give the recipe your own spin. The sweet, rich maple against the tart citrus is a great combination and there's no need to stick with the vodka of choice here.\nOf course, you can pour any of your favorite vodkas, though you might want to shake that up a bit. Think about using flavored vodkas that complement the drink's other flavors. Something like 42 Below Honey would be a fun option. You could also play off flavors that pair well with grapefruit?particularly vanilla and caramel?to give it another layer of flavor.\nVodka is not the only liquor that can work here, either. A shot of almost any whiskey?especially bourbons and rye whiskeys?can give the drink a great kick and add a nice oaky or spicy background. Feel free to go bold, too, and choose a full-flavored, over-proof whiskey. Knob Creek, Rittenhouse Rye 100, and Booker's Bourbon are a few great options.\nRum is another great choice for this sour. It will add a subtle sweetness that plays really well off the maple syrup. Consider going with an aged rum like Appleton Estate VX or Brugal A?ejo. Flavored rums, including the likes of Brinley Gold's Coffee or Vanilla Rum, would be fun additions as well. And, if you cannot get enough of spiced rum, this recipe is another excellent venue for a shot of that.\nHow Strong Is the New England Sour?\nYou'll notice that the juice makes up most of the volume in the New England sour and that helps create a rather tame drink. On average, it has an alcohol content around 11 percent ABV (22 proof), which is similar to many wines. This fact also adds to its appeal for parties because you know that your guests aren't drinking something that's too strong.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/new-england-sour-recipe-759072

The average orange should yield 2 to 3 ounces, which will be enough for a few drinks.\nWhile you're squeezing citrus juice, whip up some homemade sour mix. It's an easy flavored simple syrup that requires lemon and lime juices or either, depending on your preference.\nFor the apricot brandy, you will find many options that are actually sweetened liqueurs. While true brandy (distilled from apricots and unsweetened) is typically recommended, this is one cocktail where the liqueur version will do some good because the extra sweetness will back up the sour mix and add to the cocktail's balance.\nA sour glass is small and petite, similar to a miniature white wine glass, which makes a good alternative if you don't have the sour glass.\nChilling your glass before straining the drink will help keep your drink colder for a longer period of time. The quickest way to do it is to place a couple of ice cubes in the glass while you shake the drink.\nRecipe Variations\nYou might want to try making your own apricot-flavored brandy. It is an easy infusion that lets you choose the brandy you'd like to use. Simply add chunks of apricot to the brandy and infuse it for about 1 week, checking the flavor after the third or fourth day.\nKeep the stone fruit theme and mix the stone sour with peach brandy instead of apricot. The taste difference will be subtle, but pleasant.\nAdd a fresh sparkle to this drink with a splash of club soda or sparkling wine.\nTo transform this into a nonalcoholic drink, pour equal parts white grape juice and apricot nectar to replace the brandy.\nHow Strong Is a Stone Sour?\nThe stone sour is a pleasantly gentle cocktail. On average, it will shake up to just 11 percent ABV (22 proof), or the same as an average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/stone-sour-cocktail-recipe-759461

For a cocktail glass, a splash (or less than 1 ounce) will likely do. You\'ll need at least a couple of ounces for an old-fashioned glass. If you\'re going for a highball, you may need as much as 4 ounces. Ultimately, the point is to fill the glass.\nSlap the basil leaves between the palm of your hands to awaken the herb\'s essential oils before mixing.\nHow Strong Is a Sabai Sabai?\nObviously, the Sabai Sabai is going to be a weaker drink with the more soda you pour. Taking the club soda average of 2 ounces, this recipe is a cool 8 percent ABV (16 proof), so it\'s not much stronger than a beer.\nWhat is Mekong Liquor?\nMekhong is called ""The Official Spirit of Thailand"" and is often thought of as a style of whiskey. Yet, it does not fall into any well-known category of liquor and is unique unto itself.\nThe amber color of this liquor is deceptive. It is actually a combination of distilled sugar cane and molasses which makes it very rum-like. Yet, it\'s also similar to sake in that it includes 5 percent rice spirit (though sake is brewed and not distilled). Additionally, Mekhong is flavored with an undisclosed mixture of native Thai herbs.\nMekhong is distilled at the Bangyikhan Distillery in Bangkok, Thailand, and bottled at 35 percent ABV (70 proof). The brand was launched in 1941 and has been sold throughout Southeast Asia. Eventually, it hit the United Kingdom and European markets and, in 2008, it launched in the United States.\nRecipe Variations\nThe ginger lime-tail is a very similar drink that features Mekhong. It is also a sweet and sour highball that tops everything off with ginger beer for a little extra snap.\nTo make the drink, pour 2 ounces Mekhong with 1/2 ounce lime juice and 3 lime wheels in a collins glass filled with ice. Cover it with a shaker tin and give the drink a good shake. Top with ginger beer and add a dash of Angostura bitters.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sabai-sabai-cocktail-recipe-with-mekhong-liquor-759801

Removing the seeds from a pomegranate is the most time-consuming process of making this drink. It is worth the effort and once you have them, there are two ways to get the delicious juice.\nOne method uses hot water to extract the juice from the seeds and is commonly used when your final intention is to make grenadine. This creates a juice that is slightly watered down, but still warm and inviting.\nThe other method is a cold extraction of the juice and it will create the purest pomegranate juice because there is no water added.\nWhen creating the Sweet Adeline, I used the hot method and the diluted juice. It remains very flavorful and I would actually recommend it because straight pomegranate juice can be a little thick.\nIf you opt for the cold juicing method, add a little water to the juice: about 2 parts juice to 1 part water. This will give it a nice consistency for the drink and it also saves a bit of your precious juice!\nWhen it is not pomegranate season, feel free to use your favorite pomegranate juice. You can also add water to grenadine and stir it until you get a juice-like liquid.\nThe Tea. You can use any tea you prefer, but the best Sweet Adeline will come from a blend of black tea with orange and spices. There are many fantastic blends around that fall into this category.\nA recommendation for an easy to find spiced tea is Bigelow Constant Comment. It's available in many grocery stores and is a fantastic, affordable spiced tea for winter.\nBuy Bigelow Constant Comment at Amazon\nNo matter which tea you choose, brew it according to the recommendations of the tea company. Brewing times and temperatures are a critical piece of making a great cuppa and you really should not be steeping all of your teas the same. Constant Comment recommends 2 minutes and many black teas fall in line with this, but you will want to double check your tea of choice.\nThe Cinnamon Syrup. Cinnamon is one of the easiest homemade simple syrups you can make. All you need to do is toss a cinnamon stick in the syrup, let it steep for a few hours and you're done! It's a fantastic way to sweeten your coffee and tea and is very useful in a number of cocktails as well.\nWant to Spike the Drink?\nThis drink was created as a mocktail, but that should not stop you from adding a little liquor if you like. If you want to spike the Sweet Adeline, consider an aged rum or a good brandy. Even flavored brandies like apple or apricot will make a nice addition here because they are always just a little better when warmed up.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/sweet-adeline-drink-recipe-pomegranate-and-black-tea-760352

Both have a surprisingly dry finish and are worth trying in this cocktail. The Extra Seco rum is clear and has a light body that would probably be best for the tea infusion. The brand's Oro rum is a gold color with a medium body and a woodier taste.\nTo make removing the tea easier, place it in a mesh tea infuser ball. This will eliminate the need to strain because you simply need to remove the ball once the infusion is done.\nGinger syrup is easy to make at home and can be ready within an hour. As an alternative, if you have a bottle of ginger liqueur in stock, it's a perfect substitute.\nHow Strong Is a Mad Hatter's Tea Party?\nThe two recommended rums are bottled at 80 proof and the nonalcoholic mixers are only accents, so this is a rather strong cocktail.

If you have to dust off the bottle, it\'s time for a replacement because the fortified wine has a shelf life of just three months once opened.\nThe bitters are undefined in this recipe, though aromatic bitters (e.g., Angostura) is a natural choice. You can also try orange bitters or have fun experimenting with other flavors to give the drink a unique accent.\nAs long as you\'re upgrading each ingredient, don\'t forget about the garnish. Skip the neon red maraschinos that are so common and seek out a jar of real maraschino cherries that have not been bleached and dyed or make your own. Fresh cherries are perfect when in season, and an orange twist is a good alternative.\nRecipe Variation\nIf there is a tequila martini that could be made ""perfect,"" this would be the recipe to choose over the tequini. Aged tequila is a better pairing for the two vermouths than a blanco tequila. If you\'d like to try it, pour 2 ounces of a?ejo tequila and 1/2 ounce each of dry vermouth and sweet vermouth.\nHow Strong Is a Spanish Harlem?\nJust like any cocktail in the martini family, the Spanish Harlem is not a light drink!

Serve and enjoy.\nThe key lime pie martini is easy to make and you can improve it with a little attention to each of the ingredients.\nThe Vodka\nA clear vodka is an option for this cocktail, but vanilla vodka makes it just a little bit better. That hint of sweet vanilla in the background brings balance to the drink and marries the pineapple and lime perfectly.\nIf you want to experiment with other vodkas, use a plain cake or whipped cream vodka like Pinnacle Whipped or Three Olives Cake. These have those same sweet properties of vanilla and won't disturb the key lime pie taste with unnecessary flavors.\nThe Orange Liqueur\nTriple sec is one of the most common orange liqueurs available. Skip those $5 bottles and upgrade to something that's a little more refined. Investing in a good triple sec like Cointreau or Marie Brizard is going to be useful in your bar and improve all of your cocktails, from the margarita to the sidecar.\nOther orange liqueurs that can also be used. Stick with one of the light ones (in both color and flavor). A good curacao would be an excellent choice.\nThe Pineapple Juice\nFresh juice is best but you will need a good juicer to get it out of a pineapple (unless you feel like doing a lot of work with your muddler and strainer).\nWhen buying pineapple juice, look for the smallest cans possible. Unless you are serving key lime pie martinis to a crowd, this will help avoid waste.

You might also want to look for The King's Ginger, as it's a fabulous spirit as well.\nFresh-squeezed orange juice is highly recommended for this drink because it will match the bright flavor of the other ingredients. On average, you can expect to get 2 to 3 ounces from the average orange, leaving you plenty for a second round.\nIf you have been buying simple syrup, consider making it at home instead. It's as easy as the name implies: A simple mix of equal parts sugar and water, brought to a boil, then simmered. Let it cool before making the drink. If you're in a rush and want just a little bit, shake up a small batch in your cocktail shaker.\nDried pears are a nice garnish, but so is the fresh fruit. When slicing a fresh pear, dip each slice briefly in a little lemon juice so the flesh doesn't turn yellow when it's exposed to oxygen.\nThere's no need to worry if you don't have an ice maker capable of crushing ice. You can toss some cubes into a blender and give it a quick whirl, draining off any excess water. Or, do it manually by placing cubes in a plastic or cloth bag (a Lewis bag is designed for this purpose) and whack it with your muddler.

Just like beer, it will foam up in the glass, so stop early enough to let the head develop and add more if needed once it relaxes a little.\nTry this drink with various sarsaparillas. There are some really great options out there that are produced by smaller companies who specialize in old-timey soft drinks, each offering a slightly different taste.\nIf you're going to substitute another bourbon for Wild Turkey 101, make sure it's just as flavorful. A soft whiskey can easily get lost behind the sarsaparilla. For the biggest flavor look for bourbons that are also above 80 proof.\nRecipe Variations\nFor more of a belly-up-to-the-bar saloon feel, serve this drink in a frosty beer mug and skip the salt rim. Ice is not necessary as long as the sarsaparilla is cold.\nRoot beer is a very good substitute for the sarsaparilla. Cream soda and birch beer are two good options as well that will pair nicely with the whiskey and schnapps.\nRye whiskey is another good style that can stand up to this drink. It tends to have a spicier profile that will add a nice depth of flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Rooster Cocktail?\nThe rooster cocktail may have been inspired by a rough character, but the drink is actually quite light. It's similar to other whiskey and soda drinks and will have an alcohol content around 14 percent ABV (28 proof). This will vary, of course, depending on the strength of your whiskey and how much sarsaparilla you pour.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rooster-cocktail-recipe-761492

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nServe and enjoy.\nTips\nDry gin is a popular choice for this cocktail and the bold flavors will not get lost in the mix. You might, however, want to experiment with some of the softer gins, such as Aviation or Bloom, which tend to be more floral than piney.\nBe sure that the quality of your triple sec matches that of your gin. Cheaper options can be very syrupy and that will not produce a great cocktail. Go with top-shelf brands like Cointreau or Combier or switch to another orange liqueur like Grand Marnier.\nHeavy cream is a popular option for most creamy cocktails. Milk is a far lighter option and will work, or you can take the middle path and pour half and half.\nA chilled glass is highly recommended for this drink. It will keep the cocktail cold longer, which helps marry the flavors. To do it at the last minute, simply place a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix up the drink, then discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nThe grenadine can be replaced with almost any sweet red fruit liqueur. Try it with Chambord for a black raspberry twist, pour cr?me de cassis for a delicious black currant flavor, or go with a strawberry liqueur.\nIf the botanical profile of gin is too much, mix this cocktail up with vodka instead. You can even add more flavor with an infused vodka; vanilla, berry, or dessert vodkas would all be good options.\nHow Strong Is an Angel's Delight?\nThe angel's delight is a rather gentle cocktail with an alcohol content just a little stronger than a glass of wine. When made with 80-proof gin and 60-proof triple sec, it will shake up to about 17 percent ABV (34 proof). Its sweet taste can trick you into one too many though.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/angels-delight-cocktail-recipe-759280

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nA cocktail this simple and transparent is a perfect use for top-shelf brandy. If it\'s a brand that you enjoy on its own or in cocktails like the B&B, it\'s a good choice for the metropolitan.\nSweet vermouth is a fortified wine and does not have the long shelf life of other bottles on the liquor shelf. If your bottle has been open longer than three months, it\'s likely gone stale and needs to be replaced.\nSimple syrup is cheap and easy to make at home. All you need is sugar and water; the stovetop is optional.\nFor this and other classic cocktails, Angostura is the aromatic bitters of choice. There are many more bitters available today, and some of the unique flavors can give the metropolitan a subtle and intriguing twist.\nRecipe Variations\nInstead of simple syrup, sweeten the metropolitan with 1/2 teaspoon of superfine sugar (also called bar sugar).\nThe brandy Manhattan typically skips the sweetener and uses less vermouth (either sweet or dry). To make it, stir 2 ounces brandy, 1/2 ounce vermouth, and a dash of aromatic bitters with ice, then strain into a cocktail glass. ""The Savoy Cocktail Book"" (1930) calls this a brandy vermouth cocktail.\nIn ""The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book"" (1935), A.S. Crockett shares a metropolitan recipe that uses 2/3 Manhattan bitters (obsolete, though possibly similar to Amer Picon) and 1/3 vermouth. There\'s no brandy or bitters.\nA similar sweetened brandy drink is called the Harvard cocktail. In this classic recipe, 1 1/2 ounces brandy, 1/2 ounce sweet vermouth, 1/4 ounce lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of grenadine, and a dash of bitters are shaken then strained.\nIf you can\'t decide between brandy and whiskey, mix up a Saratoga cocktail. It pairs both spirits with sweet vermouth.\nHow Strong Is the Metropolitan?\nDrinks like the metropolitan are very strong because they\'re made primarily of liquor. On average, the alcohol content is around 29 percent ABV (78 proof). That\'s nearly as strong as drinking the brandy alone, which is why it shakes up to just a few ounces.\nClassic Cocktails Every Drinker Should Try']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/metropolitan-cocktail-recipe-759325

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe lavender sugar rim really sets this drink over the top. Don't skip it if you want to enjoy the Plumdog Millionaire's full experience. Luckily, lavender sugar is easy to make: Place 1 tablespoon of lavender in a food processor and chop it into small pieces for about 15 seconds, add 1 cup of white sugar and blend, then whisk in 1 additional cup of sugar.\nIf you cannot find Dry's version (it's getting easier as the company's distribution grows), you can make your own lavender soda by combining about 2 ounces of lavender syrup with 4 to 6 ounces of club soda. Adjust these amounts to suit your taste.\nFor another homemade ingredient, try the maesil ju recipe. It's Korea's version of plum wine that uses soju, honey, brown sugar, and green plums.\nRecipe Variation\nServe this drink on the rocks if you prefer. As written, the recipe is the ideal volume for an old-fashioned glass. It's also a lovely spritzer when served in a tall glass; add more soda to fill.\nHow Strong Is a Plumdog Millionaire?\nThe Plumdog Millionaire is as strong as the average fruit martini.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nCacha?a is becoming easier to find as exports increase. Explore various brands, but be aware that a top-shelf cacha?a always produces a better caipirinha because there's nothing in the drink to mask any impurities in the spirit.\nThe original caipirinha is made with between 1/2 teaspoon and 2 teaspoons of sugar, according to taste. The lime in that recipe definitely needs a little extra sweetness. The raspberries in this version are naturally sweet, so you won't need quite as much sugar. However, do add a little more if you want the drink a little sweeter.\nWhile the caipirinha is most often stirred, you can shake it. To do so, secure a mixing tin over top of the serving glass and give it a quick shake up and down (do not tilt it like a cocktail shaker) while holding onto both vessels. This doesn't work for every glass because some old-fashioned glasses don't have a wide enough rim to get a tight seal with the tin. Do a test with water before trying this method so you don't spill your drink everywhere.\nThe other option is to make the drink in a cocktail shaker, shake it, then pour the entire contents into your glass. It's not traditional, though, as the caipirinha is typically made directly in the glass.\nRecipe Variations\nThe raspberry caipirinha can also be shaken after muddling and strained into a cocktail glass for a refreshing raspberry-flavored caipirini.\nAdd more fruits to the muddle for extra flavor. Other berries like blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries are excellent choices, though you can also toss in a few lime wedges.\nRamp up the raspberry flavor by pouring half a shot of raspberry liqueur (e.g., Chambord). Raspberry-flavored vodka or rum can also give it a nice kick.\nHow Strong Is a Raspberry Caipirinha?\nLike the whiskey old-fashioned, when making a caipirinha you're essentially just dressing up a straight shot of liquor and diluting it a bit with ice. That means this is not a light drink and its alcohol content will be slightly lower than the liquor you pour. Generally, with an 80-proof cacha?a, the raspberry caipirinha will weigh in around 29 percent ABV (58 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/raspberry-caipirinha-recipe-760558

Do this before salting the rim. If you have all the ingredients ready, it should keep a nice frost while you mix up the drink.\nAs with any margarita, choose a good tequila that you enjoy drinking on its own. Generally, a mid-range to top-shelf blanco tequila is a great fit for this drink.\nFor the orange liqueur, triple sec or orange cura?ao are good choices. Just be sure that the quality matches that of your tequila. Some of the least expensive options are very syrupy and artificially flavored, which will bring down the drink.\nFreshly squeezed citrus juice will produce the best-tasting margarita. Limes and tangerines typically yield about 1 1/2 ounces of juice per fruit, so one of each will be enough for at least a couple of cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nThe typical margarita options work well with this version. If you prefer, serve it on the rocks by straining it over fresh ice in your glass.\nThis mix can also be placed in a blender with 1 cup of ice for a quick frozen cocktail. It's good to toss some fresh tangerine pieces in as well. Be sure to remove the peel.\nHow Strong Is a Tangerine Margarita?\nMost shaken margaritas are relatively strong cocktails and the tangerine margarita is no exception. When made with 80-proof tequila and 60-proof orange liqueur, this recipe shakes up to about 24 percent ABV (48 proof).

The fortified wine doesn\'t have the long shelf life of distilled spirits. It will begin to go stale and lose its flavor with time. Also, it\'s best to refrigerate the bottle once it\'s open.\nThe tequini is best when served in a chilled glass. If you don\'t have one pre-chilled, simply place a few ice cubes in the glass while preparing the drink, then discard them before straining.\nThe chile pepper garnish adds a nice spicy kick to this cocktail and, depending on your taste, is almost a better fit for the tequila than an olive.\nRecipe Variations\nBlanco tequilas are typically best with dry vermouth, though an aged tequila can work well.\nIf you want to switch to a sweeter tequini, try the Spanish Harlem. Sweet vermouth is actually a better fit for reposado and a?ejo tequilas.\nYou could even make a ""perfect"" tequini with equal parts of dry and sweet vermouth. Again, this would be a good mix for those aged tequilas.\nHow Strong Is a Tequini?\nAlmost every martini is going to be a strong drink and the tequini is no exception.

In fact, this recipe was originally intended to use Skyy Ginger, but that was short-lived and is now discontinued (not an unusual situation). There are a few companies that do produce it; Belvedere Ginger Zest is probably the most widely distributed option. Many small distilleries do take on the flavor, though, so be sure to keep an eye out for brands that are new to you. Ginger vodka is amazing and worth the hunt!\nThe other option is to go with a homemade ginger vodka infusion. This allows you to use any vodka you choose, though it does take almost two weeks to reach its peak flavor. You will need 1/2 cup of fresh, sliced ginger for a 750ml bottle of vodka. Place the two ingredients in an infusion jar, shake every couple of days, and store it in a cool, dark place until the flavor reaches your desired intensity.\nA cocktail with this much spice is definitely going to be best when served in a chilled cocktail glass. If you don't have one pre-chilled, place a few ice cubes in it while shaking up the drink, then dump them out before straining.\nRecipe Variation\nServe this cocktail on the rocks in an old-fashioned glass if you prefer.\nHow Strong Is a Sweet Heat Cocktail?\nSince ginger vodka is the only liquor in this cocktail, it's lighter than most drinks of this style.

Enjoy.\nTips\nNot Too Much. Don't fill your glass completely with cola, but leave a little room on the top. This will prevent splashes and spills as you get your twister spinning.\nThe Booze. The Tornado is more novelty than an impressive drink, so there's really no need to spend a significant amount of cash on the liquor that goes inside. Just as with any of the Long Island style of drinks, use the bottles in your bar's 'well' for this one.\nIt's All About the Effect. Ingredients really don't matter much with the Tornado because the drink is a spectacle that just happens to be drinkable. That means you should care more about the visual effect and the taste will take care of itself.\nEnjoy it While it Lasts. The ice and sugar will only last so long under agitation. The sugar will eventually dissolve into the drink and the ice will melt faster. We typically fill a glass with ice to slow dilution and those three lonely cubes have a lot of work to do. Add in the swirling and they'll be gone before you know it.\n\nHow Strong is the Tornado?\nComparing the Tornado to the Long Island makes one realize the difference the 1-ounce pours of liquor can make. The more popular drink is typically made with 1/2-ounce of each liquor and it uses much more ice to help out with dilution, so that drink can be as mild as 30 proof.\n\nThe Tornado is a different story. We knock the ice down significantly, skip the sour mix, and the liquor volume totals 4 ounces (rather than the 2 1/2 ounces in the Long Island).

The same advice pertains to whole cloves.\nBoth spices are rather pungent. If you're using a ground version, just a pinch will do. A couple of whole pieces will offer a good flavor, especially if you crush them and let them rest for a minute or two in the syrup and molasses.\nChoose either light or dark molasses for this recipe. The dark variety will produce a more intense flavor. Blackstrap molasses is not recommended because it's much stronger. If that's your only option, decrease the amount by at least half.\nRecipe Variations\nSweeten this martini to suit your taste. You can add as much as 1 ounce each of molasses and simple syrup.\nPear is not a flavor found in ginger snap cookies, though it does add an interesting dimension to this cocktail.

Do this about 4 or 5 times.\nPour the mix into another heat-resistant cup with a lemon peel, then put 1 of the mugs over the top to extinguish the flames before drinking.\nSafety Tips\nWhen making this drink, you are literally playing with fire! Safety is your top priority when mixing alcohol and fire, so play it smart and follow a few tips. Many of these come from David Wondrich\'s book ""Imbibe!"" for pouring a blue blazer:\nPractice pouring with water first. Go outside during your first few attempts at flaming. It\'s also a good idea to pour over a tray full of water.\nClean up any liquor spills before lighting the fire. If your flame jumps onto the table where you accidentally spilled that rum or vodka, the fire can quickly get out of control.\nTie back long hair and loose clothing. Make sure all flammables are out of the way, including paper napkins and bar towels.\nHave a fire extinguisher nearby. You will notice that in almost every video of ""flaming shots gone wrong,"" it is the one thing that\'s missing. Rarely do you even see a nonalcoholic drink?small fires can be put out with water?so be prepared just in case an accident does happen.\nUse a self-extinguishing lighter. The average cigarette lighter is better than matches or a Zippo-style lighter because as soon as your thumb releases the lever the flame goes out.\nPour drinks into thick glassware. The heat of the flames can quickly shatter thin glass, spilling liquor and fire all over the bar, table, and you.\nDon\'t overfill the glass. Leave some room at the top of the glass to prevent splashes from going over the sides. Pour only half of the liquid each time.\nYou don\'t want the fire to go out while pouring.\nMix it quick as the handles of the mugs will get hot.\nTurn the lights down to get the full effect and to make it easier to see what you are doing.\nAlways Extinguish before Drinking \nThe flaming liquor can easily spill down your chin and onto your clothes or hair, causing a fireball effect and severe burns. Best case scenario, it may singe your nose hairs or leave you with no eyebrows, and neither of those options is pleasant either.\nSnuff Rather Than Blow\nIt is very easy to get too close to a flaming glass when attempting to blow out the flames, and your hair can quickly catch on fire. Instead, use a stainless steel mixing tin (jiggers work for shot glasses) to cover the flaming glass until the fire is out.\nKeep Guests Back From the Flames\nThis is an important note for bartenders as well: Don\'t let your patrons ooh and ahh right next to that flaming shot on the bar. Always put out the fire before they get close.\nIf You\'ve Been Drinking, Don\'t Try It\nSeriously, playing with fire while you are drunk is never a good idea, so just don\'t do it. Make the drink without fire, and save yourself a trip to the emergency room or a visit from the fire department.\nKnow Your Skills\nThis is particularly important for the blue blazer. Pouring flaming whiskey back and forth between mugs is not an endeavor to undertake on a whim in one of those ""I bet I could do that!"" moments.\nHow Strong Is a Blue Blazer?\nThe water added to the blue blazer knocks the scotch down to a comfortable sipper. The alcohol content will come out to about 23 percent ABV (46 proof) when made with an 80-proof whiskey.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jerry-thomas-classic-blue-blazer-cocktail-761417

This will result in more of a teardrop shape than a ball, but it's still very fun.\nChampagne may be recommended, but it's not required. Pour any sparkling wine you like; you can often save money by going with a sparkling ros?.\nRecipe Variation\nYou can freeze a complementary juice into your ice balls and put that into the punch bowl. As it melts, the liquid will merge into the punch without watering it down. Try white grape, grapefruit, or pineapple juice. They'll each give the punch a fun twist.\nHow Strong Is a Jim Beam Fruit Punch?\nThe exact alcohol content each of your guests has in their glass is going to depend on how much punch and wine you pour. As a general estimate, the finished drink should fall somewhere in the 18 percent ABV (36 proof) range. That's stronger than a glass of wine and a little lighter than cocktails like the cosmopolitan.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nLaird's Applejack is one of the best options for that American style of apple brandy. Other brands to look for include Cedar Ridge, E&J, Paul Masson, St. George, and Santa Fe.\nFrench calvados offers a number of options as well. Most are not from well-known brands, but they're rarely disappointing and the apple flavor tends to be more pronounced and brighter. Pick up any bottle you see and try it in this cocktail.\nBe sure your orange cura?ao matches the quality of the brandy you choose. Marie Brizard and Se?or Cura?ao are two excellent options to look for.\nThough always recommended, fresh lemon juice is definitely preferred here. The average lemon yields just over 1 1/2 ounces of juice, enough for a few cocktails.\nRecipe Variations\nThough an equal pour of each of the accent ingredients is most common and traditional, some drinkers prefer to tweak them. For instance, one variation pours 1 1/2 ounces apple brandy, 3/4 ounce Benedictine, 1/4 ounce triple sec, and 1/2 ounce lemon juice.\nIn true sour drink fashion, you can also add an egg white to this cocktail. It will give the drink a luxurious texture and foamy top, but not add a real eggy flavor. If you go this route, ensure your egg is fresh and shake the cocktail harder and longer than normal to ensure the egg is thoroughly mixed in.\nHow Strong Is a Honeymoon Cocktail?\nLike most drinks served in the martini style, the honeymoon cocktail is a very strong drink.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nTo get the most flavor out of your tea leaves, brew it with hot water then chill it.\nFollow the recommended brewing time on the package at first. You can always make adjustments to suit your taste. If your tea is bitter, it's possible that it was brewed too long.\nIf you prefer to use a sugar substitute like Splenda, use it to make a simple syrup. Use the same amount of Splenda as you would white sugar. This pre-dissolves the granules making it easier to mix into cold drinks.\nRecipe Variations\nA splash of lemon juice can give this drink a bright accent.\nServe this drink as a taller spiked ice tea. Increase the brandy to 2 ounces and double up on the green tea, too. This should fit nicely in a collins glass that's filled with ice.\nIf you like, the ginger tea also works well when served warm, creating a drink similar to the hot toddy. Simply switch from chilled green tea to hot tea. Either mix it up in an Irish coffee glass or teacup or strain it into one to remove the ginger and mint.\nMake this into a big-batch tea drink for a party. Increase the ingredients, Keeping the cognac to tea ratio at 1:2 (1:3 is a good mix, though). Instead of muddling the ginger, consider making ginger syrup and using that instead of plain simple syrup. A few extra mint leaves can be added to the pitcher and will infuse the drink over time.\nHow Strong Is a Ginger Tea?\nThe Hennessy green tea is a very mild cocktail that's about the same as drinking a glass of wine.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nGenerally, it's best to stir spirit-only cocktails, but the San Francisco cocktail is a good exception to that rule. Sloe gin is thick, and shaking aerates the drink and lightens up the mix. However, this is also a matter of personal preference, so try it stirred to see which method you like best.\nVermouth has a shorter shelf life than distilled spirits. Once the bottles are open, store the fortified wine in the fridge and use it within three months.\nHow Strong Is the San Francisco?\nSloe gin varies by brand, though the average is 26 percent alcohol by volume (ABV, 52 proof). That ensures that the San Francisco cocktail is nice and mild, with an alcohol content in the 16 percent ABV (32 proof) range. That's about half the strength of a gin martini and just a touch stronger than a glass of wine.\nWhat Drink Is San Francisco Known For?\nSan Francisco bartenders have been mixing up great drinks for a very long time. Some well-known drinks were either created there or found a second home in the city. The Bay Area is famous for the gin martini, its predecessor, the Martinez, pisco punch, and the unforgettable mai tai.

There are various grades and styles of sake to explore and the selection is almost as complicated as choosing vodka. Even a brand like Gekkeikan offers a variety of expressions, so try this cocktail with a few different sakes to discover which you enjoy most.\nIf you're going to replace Cointreau with another orange liqueur, ensure it's equal in quality to the premium triple sec. You might want to avoid brandy-based options like Grand Marnier because it can be too heavy for this particular drink.\nFor a splash of fresh lime, simply squeeze the juice from a lime wedge directly into your shaker.\nServing this cocktail in a chilled glass keeps it cold longer and is highly recommended. For a quick chill, simply place a few ice cubes in the glass while you're shaking the drink, then discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nAs with the cosmo, adjust the cranberry juice to suit your taste. The recommended pour creates a slightly dry cocktail, while a little extra juice (up to 1 ounce) will produce a sweeter drink.\nYou can also pour white cranberry juice. It tends to be less sweet and not as heavily flavored as the standard red variety.\nAdding more lime juice is not a bad idea either. The cosmo uses 1/2 ounce, which you can typically get from half a lime, and the extra citrus adds a nice boost to the drink's flavor.\nHow Strong Is a Cherry Blossom Tini?\nSake is generally a little lighter than vodka, so that helps bring this cocktail's strength down, though it's not significant.

There are many available and most will work out just as well.\nInstead of a lemon-lime sports drink, pour lemonade or a lemon-lime soda such as Sprite or 7-Up.\nYou can substitute sour mix for the orange juice to be a little more authentic to the Long Island iced tea taste. It\'s easy to make sour mix at home because it\'s simply citrus-flavored syrup.\nHow Strong Is a Touchdown Tea?\nUsing orange juice rather than triple sec helps bring the touchdown tea down to a reasonable strength for a party punch.

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon wheel, sprig of rosemary, or both. Serve and enjoy.\nTo Make Fresh Rhubarb Juice\nFor the rhubarb juice, if you have a higher-end juicer you should be all set. Simply clean the stalks and juice away (some cheaper juicers will have a hard time with rhubarb). For those without a juicer, you will have to do it the old-fashioned way and the technique will give you almost the same results.\nDo note that rhubarb juice likes to separate after about 20-30 minutes. It's often best to let it settle then strain off the yellowish 'sludge' to get a clean, blush pink juice. The juice is a great way to use up your leftover rhubarb. It mixes with other fresh juices and is a great addition to lemonade as well.\nMakes about 2 quarts.\n2 pounds of rhubarb, cut into 1-inch pieces\n8 cups water (or enough to cover the rhubarb)\nTo make the juice:\nPlace the cut rhubarb into a pot and cover with water.\nBring to a boil over high heat, then cover and reduce the heat.\nAllow to simmer for 15 minutes.\nStrain using a fine mesh strainer and press the rhubarb with the back of a spoon to get all of the juice.\nAllow to cool for about 4 hours in the refrigerator.\nIf the rhubarb juice separates into a thick, yellowish layer and a pink juice, strain it again until you have only the juice. Use cheesecloth if necessary.\nHow Strong Is the Rhubarb-Rosemary Daiquiri?\nRum is the only liquor in this daiquiri, so it's a relatively mild cocktail. This adds to its appeal as a light, refreshing drink for spring and summer affairs. With an 80-proof rum, the drink weighs in with an alcohol content right around 17 percent ABV (34 proof).\nWant More Rhubarb Cocktails?\nOnce you get a taste for a rhubarb drink, you will want more. It's a unique taste and a ton of fun to experiment with. While you have that juice around, give the rhubarb collins a try.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/rhubarb-rosemary-daiquiri-recipe-760480

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nFeel free to pour your favorite rum. Aged or dark rums are going to be best because light rums can get lost within all the drink's complex flavor.\nK?mmel is focused on caraway seed and typically includes cumin and fennel as well, combining to give it an anise-like flavor. It's not the easiest liqueur to find, but worth hunting down. Look for brands like Combier, Mentzendorff, and Wolfschmidt.\nFresh-squeezed orange juice is recommended. You should be able to get 2 to 3 ounces out of the average orange, so you'll have plenty for a few cocktails.\nServing this cocktail in a chilled glass will make the entire drinking experience a little more enjoyable. Not only does it stay cold longer, but it also helps marry the flavors.\nFor a quick chill, place a few ice cubes in the glass while you mix up the drink. Discard them before straining.\nRecipe Variations\nOne variation of this cocktail uses the same four ingredients, but in a different ratio that focuses less on the rum. To make it, shake 1 ounce light rum with 3/4 ounce each of kummel and orange juice, adding a dash of pimento dram.\nAquavit is a good substitute for kummel. It focuses on caraway, though some producers use dill either alone or with caraway, and other herbs may be included.\nHow Strong Is a Surprised Cocktail?\nMost kummel is bottled around 76 proof, making it nearly as strong as the rum you'll pour in the surprised cocktail. With that foundation, this is not a light drink.

Typically, this is 1 1/2 ounces.\nIt's often best to make your own sour mix (also called sweet and sour mix or bar mix), especially when it's such a high-volume ingredient in a recipe. It's very easy?essentially a citrus-flavored simple syrup?and will create better drinks than most store-bought mixes.\nIf you find that this drink is a little too tart, try it with just 1 ounce of sour mix and work your way up from there.\nWhile it may seem insignificant, the lemon squeeze is necessary. It brings balance to the drink and adds a pop of freshness that opens up the flavors of the other ingredients (much like adding a dash of bitters in other cocktails).\nFor the cola, you might consider stepping away from popular brands like Coke and Pepsi and try one from the smaller, crafted soda companies. Q Kola is a fantastic option because it is a much lighter, less sugary version that will not hide the other ingredients.\nHow Strong Is a Pyrat Summer Tea?\nThe actual alcohol content of your Pyrat summer tea will depend on how much soda you end up pouring.

The ice helps fill the volume of a cocktail glass, though.\nIf you'd like to make it a little taller, pour 1 1/2 ounces each of the B?renj?ger and vodka, then double up on the cranberry and sour mix.\nIce cubes are a little awkward in the V-shape of a cocktail glass. A better option is crushed ice. You can create it quickly without an ice machine by placing a few cubes in a plastic zipper bag (a cloth Lewis bag is designed for this purpose), then whacking them into small pieces with your muddler or a rolling pin.\nOf course, you can always skip the ice, just be sure your glass is chilled for the best tasting drink.\nRecipe Variations\nAs an alternative to sour mix, add a squeeze of juice from a lime wedge.\nPour a flavored vodka if you like. Good choices for this drink include citrus, vanilla, and any berry vodka.\nWhite cranberry juice is a fabulous option for this cocktail. It's a little less sweet, so it's a good pairing with the honey liqueur.\nLighten up this drink by topping it off with sparkling wine. A sweet sparkling Moscato would be a nice choice. You could go with a dry sparkling ros? to counteract the martini's underlying sweetness and bring in an extra dose of pink.\nHow Strong Is a Pink Honey Martini?\nOne reason this cocktail is served short is that it's a very potent mix. Don't let its sweet taste fool you! When made with the average 80-proof vodka, it weighs in at 28 percent ABV (56 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAny citrus vodka can be used in this cocktail. It\'s the most popular flavored vodka and the majority of vodka brands produce at least one option.\nQuite often, ""citrus"" vodka refers to a blend of citrus fruits. You can certainly pour a vodka that features a lone fruit, including grapefruit, lemon, lime, or orange.\nFresh cilantro is best for cocktails. You can reduce the herb\'s flavor by tearing the leaves then adding them to the muddle. Remember that it\'s a very flavorful herb, so don\'t go overboard!\nRecipe Variations\nThis is a perfect recipe to transform into a big-batch cocktail and serve by the pitcher. Make as much as you like, keeping the vodka to soda ratio somewhere around 1:4. For instance, to fill a 60-ounce pitcher filled with ice, begin with 1 cup of vodka and 4 cups of soda, sweetening it with 1/3 cup of syrup. Use a whole sliced cucumber and add a small sprig of cilantro to the muddle. Stir it up and adjust any ingredient as you see fit.\nGood herbs to use as a substitute for cilantro include basil, mint, and sage. Each is mild in comparison to cilantro, so you can get away with a few leaves for a single cocktail and larger sprigs for a punch.\nHow Strong Is a Citron Sipper?\nThe standard strength for flavored vodka is 70 proof, though there are some 80-proof bottles out there. Either way, this is going to be a very mild cocktail, weighing in somewhere around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).

This makes the cocktail a fun one to play around with. It's also a perfect recipe to rely on while exploring new bottles of gin.\nFor a rather bold White Lady, opt for a traditional London dry gin like those from Beefeater, Tanqueray, or Martin Miller. When you're in the mood for something a bit more delicate, reach for a bottle of Aviation or Hendrick's. All of these are readily available and among the brands that every gin lover should know.\nFor those times when you feel like discovering a uniquely crafted gin, you'll find plenty of options as well. A bottle from The Botanist has a fascinating array of Scottish botanicals and Bloom is truly a garden in a glass.\nDon't forget about the American craft gins, either. St. George Spirits and Leopold Bros. are two U.S. distilleries giving European gins a run for their money on this style of liquor. In fact, you might check with your local distillery to see if they're creating a gin you didn't know about. \nNo matter which gin you choose to pour, stick with Cointreau or an orange liqueur of comparable quality and be sure your lemon juice is fresh. The White Lady is not a cocktail to be frugal with, so pour the best and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is the White Lady?\nThough the cocktail looks all delicate and innocent, the White Lady packs a punch when it comes to the alcohol content. When made with an 80-proof gin and Cointreau, you can expect her to weigh in right around 25 percent ABV (50 proof). This isn't out of sorts, either, as the majority of alcohol-dominant gin martinis are just as strong.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/delilah-cocktail-recipe-759293

Stir well.\nGarnish with a slice of orange and a cinnamon stick. Serve and enjoy.\nRecipe Variations\nTo serve the milk and honey warm, top the shot of B?n?dictine off with warm milk. Be sure to heat your milk slowly and gently (never letting it boil) while stirring constantly so it doesn't curdle.\nYou can also dust the top of the drink with ground cinnamon and/or nutmeg if you prefer.\nWhile a traditional milk and honey calls for B?n?dictine, you can break from the standard and pour another honey liqueur if you like. B?renj?ger would be the top-rated substitute, though you do lose that herbal background. Another good pairing for milk is a whiskey-based liqueur like Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey, which will add a nice punch of flavor.\nTips\nWhile typically optional, this is one recipe where the garnishes make a difference. Laying the cinnamon stick and orange slice in the milk allows those flavors to slowly infuse into the drink, creating a more complex taste.\nLarge pieces of ice?cubes or larger ice balls?would be preferred over crushed ice or similar small forms in the cold drink. You want to gently dilute the drink and keep it cool from beginning to end, but not water down the milk.\nHow Strong Is a Milk and Honey Cocktail?\nThe milk and honey is a comforting drink and it's not too strong, either. Whether you make it hot or cold, you can expect its alcohol content to be around 8 percent ABV (16 proof); the ice will dilute that just a little bit in the chilled version.

Add a splash of orange liqueur to each glass.\nGarnish each glass with a slice of lime. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe original recipe calls for a gold tequila, but feel free to stray from that recommendation because there are so many great tequilas to choose from. A blanco tequila is always a good choice. For a slightly darker flavor profile, try a reposado tequila.\nFresh lime juice is going to produce a better tasting cocktail. On average, a large lime should yield around 1 ounce, which is perfect for this recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you like, you could pour a single large cocktail. However, it shakes up to around 6 ounces, which is very tall for a martini-style drink (they average 3 ounces). A great alternative is to serve it in a highball glass over ice so you can enjoy it more slowly. Mason jar glasses would be fun, too.\nAdd more Grand Marnier (or another orange liqueur) if you like. The splash is just a recommendation, though some drinkers pour as much as 1 ounce per drink.\nJust like in the cosmopolitan, adjust the cranberry juice to your personal taste. Some drinkers will prefer a sweet fruit flavor and add a little more, while others may like it best with less, creating a drink on the drier side.\nIf you pour less cranberry juice, make up the difference with tequila. This recipe could easily be enjoyed with 3 ounces of tequila, giving each glass a full shot.\nAnother great option is to switch to white cranberry juice. It's not quite as sweet as the typical red juice and the color of the cocktail will change, but it will produce a nicely balanced drink.\nHow Strong Is a Passion Cocktail?\nSince a tall shot of tequila is split between two glasses and Grand Marnier is added by the splash, the passion cocktail is a surprisingly light drink. It will shake up to around 12 percent ABV (24 proof), which is nearly half the strength of the weakest cosmo.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/passion-cocktail-recipe-759778

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWarming up your mug helps the drink stays warm to the last sip and it takes just a little bit of extra time. One option is to fill the mug with hot water (from a teapot, for instance) while you make the cocoa. The other way is to heat the water-filled mug in the microwave for about 10 seconds.\nIf you're going with the powdered cocoa option, mix that with hot milk or water separately. This ensures that it's completely dissolved before adding it to the rum.\nHow Strong Is a Mound Bar?\nMost coconut rums are actually liqueurs because of added sweeteners and they're bottled at 70 proof. That starts the drink off just a touch lighter than the average rum cocktail. Though it will ultimately depend on how much cocoa you pour, you can expect the mounds bar to weigh in around 8 percent ABV (16 proof). That's right between beer and wine, so there's not much chance of getting drunk off one mug.\nRecipe Variations\nPour coconut vodka rather than rum. There are just a few brands that produce the flavor; one of the best is C?roc Vodka, though New Amsterdam makes a nice one that's a little more reasonably priced.\nYou can also use any unflavored rum you like, then add the coconut flavor with coconut milk (coconut cream works, too). For this version, stick with the 2 ounces of rum, add 1 ounce of coconut milk (more or less to taste), then fill the mug with cocoa.\nUsing coconut milk instead of rum and skipping the liquor completely makes a delicious nonalcoholic mounds bar.\nIf you want to really play with your drink, place a Mounds Bar in the cocoa and let it melt away, adding extra chocolate and coconut. (You may need a spoon to eat the coconut.) The idea is inspired by a fun Argentinian hot chocolate drink called el submarino in which a piece of dark chocolate is melted in warm milk as you drink.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/mound-bar-cocktail-recipe-760544

However, the pomegranate is not the easiest fruit to get juice from?you need to mash the arils (seeds) then strain out the juice?it\'s not difficult, just somewhat tedious. Plus, it\'s a winter fruit with a relatively short season.\nThe next best thing is to choose a quality bottled pomegranate juice. There are many options available that will let you enjoy the Patr?n pomegranate year-round.\nThe original recipe recommends Patr?n Citr?nge. You can substitute it with another clear-colored orange liqueur; triple sec and orange cura?ao are excellent choices.\nThough the Patr?n recipe recommends the brand\'s silver tequila, it is just as tasty with reposado tequila. That little bit of aging can add a nice depth to this simple drink.\nThe recipe is also an easy one to transform into a big-batch cocktail so you can quench the thirsts of any number of guests. Simply increase the pours of each ingredient for the number of servings you need, pour it all into a pitcher with ice, and serve.\nHow Strong Is a Patr?n Pomegranate?\nThe actual strength of your Patr?n pomegranate cocktail is going to depend on how much juice you pour to fill the glass. At the recommended volume in the recipe, this drink comes out with an alcohol content right around 12 percent ABV (24 proof). It\'s light and refreshing and equivalent to drinking a glass of the average wine.\nRecipe Variations\nA cocktail called the pom padre (created by Ryan Kelley, the ""Tequila Examiner"") takes the tequila-pomegranate cocktail to a new level by adding extra flavors. The recipe uses 2 ounces of a blanco tequila, 1/2 ounce each of B?n?dictine and Pama liqueurs, 1/4 ounce of Patr?n Citr?nge, and 1 ounce each of cranberry and pineapple juices. Shake it and serve the drink up in a cocktail glass.\nPomegranate is not the only fruit juice worthy of a simple tequila cocktail.

The story goes that this drink\'s creation was actually a marketing plan developed by the Caucus Club\'s owner, Lester Gruber, and an ""ad man"" named John Hurley who had an account with Campbell\'s.\nFor the lemon juice, you can simply squeeze the juice from a lemon wedge into the shaker.\nRecipe Variations\nEvery ingredient in the bull shot can be adapted to your individual taste, and you can add all sorts of savory ingredients:\nBuild the ingredients directly in the serving glass and stir rather than shake. You can also roll the drink between two glasses to mix it.\nUse another variety of hot sauce rather than Tabasco, or skip this sauce entirely.\nAdd a pinch of cayenne pepper or a teaspoon (or two) of horseradish.\nAdd a pinch of salt.\nSoak celery salt with the Worcestershire sauce, then top the drink with vodka and broth before adding the other ingredients.\nDilute canned broth with water using 2 parts broth and 1 part water.\nAdd a dash of Angostura Bitters.

Shake well.\nStrain into the prepared cocktail glass.\nGarnish with a lemon wheel. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSpearmint is the preferred variety of mint. It is most likely the one labeled ""mint"" that you\'ll find at the grocery store. Nearly any other option will do just fine, though peppermint is known to be stronger. Use just a couple of leaves if that\'s your only option.\nThere are many limoncellos available and they should be relatively easy to find at the liquor store.\nFor the fresh lemon sour, use the recipe for sour mix and make it with lemon juice only. It\'s simple to make and is, essentially, just a citrus-flavored syrup. The fastest way to make it is to simply combine equal parts of lemon juice and simple syrup.\nIf you can, avoid bottled sour mixes. Not only do they typically contain a blend of citrus flavors that will throw off this drink, but they\'re often also artificially flavored. Besides, making your own sour mix can cost less than a dollar so you\'ll save money while improving your cocktails.\nHow Strong Is a Good Luck Charm?\nIt can be easy to think that whiskey always creates strong drinks because the spirit\'s reputation can give that impression. Surprisingly, this bourbon cocktail is lighter than most vodka martinis, including the famous lemon drop martini which has a similar taste profile. And yet, it is still not the lightest drink you can mix up. Its alcohol content should fall somewhere around 17 percent ABV (34 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nBe sure to rinse the basil and strawberries well under water before adding them to the glass. Pat the basil dry before cutting. This will remove any dust and debris so it doesn\'t end up in your drink.\nTo ""julienne"" the basil means to cut the leaves into thin strips. This wakes up the herb\'s essence and makes it more fragrant in the muddle.\nRecipe Variations\nThough vanilla works really well with the apple, strawberry, and basil flavors in this drink, pour another vodka if you prefer. Clear, unflavored vodka is a good option, though you can try it with other flavors as well.\nYou could also pour rum or tequila, both of which will add a little more flavor. Vanilla rum is a great choice if you want to retain that flavor.\nKeep the vanilla flavor when choosing an unflavored liquor or play up that flavor profile by making a vanilla simple syrup and using that instead of the plain syrup.\nHow Strong Is an Orchard Catch Cooler?\nThe vodka gives the hard cider a little boost, resulting in a mixed drink that\'s just a little stronger than the cider itself. Angry Orchard is 5 percent ABV and Stoli Vanil is 35 percent ABV, combining for a cocktail that\'s around 8 percent ABV (16 proof).

Test the fit of the two vessels before adding the ingredients.\nIt also helps to leave a little room at the top of the glass. Use a large old-fashioned glass and don't fill it to the rim.\nJust in case, wrap a towel around the bottom of the glass and shaker to catch any splashes.\nAlternatively, pour everything into your cocktail shaker, give it a couple shakes, then pour it all into the glass.\nHalf-and-half is a great choice for cream cocktails served on the rocks because it's neither too thick nor too thin. If you like, use milk or cream instead. Dairy alternatives, such as almond, rice, or soy milk can work as well.\nA drink like this does not require the best liquor to taste good because of the cream's heavy flavor. You can save a little money by pouring a good budget-friendly vodka or tequila.\nRecipe Variation\nMix the dirty bird up with a flavored vodka that complements the coffee and cream. Vanilla, chocolate, or whipped cream vodkas would be excellent options. You can also give it a caffeine kick with an espresso vodka.\nHow Strong Is a Dirty Bird?\nCompared to similar drinks, the dirty bird is a light cocktail.

Fill with ice.\nShake well and strain into a cocktail glass.\nDecorate with hard caramel strings. Serve and enjoy.\nThe Caramel Garnish\nA fun project for the kitchen, making a webbing of hard caramel strings is not very difficult, though there are some tricks to it. You can use a basic caramel recipe and create them in any shape you desire. With practice, you can create a large web that rests on top of the glass rim (have a glass nearby for a reference on the desired diameter). However, the webbing may break into smaller pieces and that's ok. Just take the neatest looking pieces and stand them upright in the glass.\nTo make the caramel, combine 1 cup white granulated sugar with 1/4 cup of water and stir to dissolve. Bring to a boil and leave it. The mix should start to turn brown just after 8 minutes?swirl the pan to mix the colors?and remove it from the heat as soon as it's amber-colored.\nThe second step is the fun part but work very quickly! Dunk the saucepan in a bowl of ice water (or a cold water-filled sink) right away to stop the caramel from cooking further. Once the pan stops sizzling, remove it from the water and stir the caramel. Using a spoon, drizzle the caramel in the desired web-like shape onto a baking sheet that's very well coated with cooking spray. Let the caramel harden (about 15 minutes), then remove the candy with a spatula. Clean up your pan by filling it with really hot water; just let it soak and the extra caramel will dissolve.\nThe caramel webs can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week in an airtight container; separate layers with parchment paper to prevent sticking. You can use the caramel to decorate desserts and other goodies as well.\nRecipe Variation\nAs an alternative garnish, dust the top of the cocktail with powdered sugar and add a few fresh berries, in cr?me br?l?e fashion. A sprinkle of ground nutmeg or cinnamon would be nice as well and either can be blended with the powdered sugar.\nHow Strong Is a Cr?me Brulee Martini?\nLike most martinis, this cocktail may be utterly delicious but it's not light on the alcohol. That's okay because it's so rich that you'll probably only want one (alright, maybe two). On average, it should mix up to 21 percent ABV (42 proof) or so, which is half the strength of a vodka shot.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/creme-brulee-martini-761038

You can make superfine sugar from granulated sugar; it is recommended because the finer grains dissolve better.\nTo avoid that entirely, use a 1:1 simple syrup instead; 1/4 ounce (1 1/2 teaspoons) is a good place to start. Some recipes use up to 3/4 ounce, though that can be too sweet for most brandies.\nGomme syrup is often used in alcohol-heavy cocktails like this, and 1 teaspoon will give the brandy smash a silky texture.\nRecipe Variations\n""Professor"" Jerry Thomas is the most revered bartender of the 19th century. His 1862 book, ""How to Mix Drinks or The Bon Vivant\'s Companion,"" was the world\'s first bartending guide and remains a valuable resource for making classic cocktails.\nTo make Thomas\' brandy smash, dissolve 1 teaspoon of superfine sugar into 2 teaspoons of water in a cocktail shaker. Add 2 ounces of brandy and 2 sprigs of mint and shake well. Strain into an old-fashioned glass filled with cracked ice and garnish with mint or an orange slice and seasonal berries.\nLike Thomas\' whiskey smash, a few pieces of lemon can really brighten up the flavor with the right brandy. Two dashes of orange bitters is a nice addition to this version.\nThe gin smash was an equally popular drink in the 1800s. It was typically made with genever (commonly called Holland gin at the time), and the substitution works in either the brandy or whiskey smash recipes.\nWhat\'s the best liquor for a smash cocktail?\nThough nearly any brandy works well, many drinkers prefer cognac in the brandy smash. Whether you choose brandy, rye whiskey, bourbon, or gin, the liquor forms most of the drink, so make it a good one. This is a drink that deserves a brand you enjoy drinking straight because there is little else in the drink to disguise a poor choice.\nHow Strong Is the Brandy Smash?\nThe brandy is the main ingredient of the brandy smash, and the finished drink is just slightly below the liquor\'s bottling strength. If you pour an 80-proof brandy, expect the alcohol content to fall somewhere around 23 percent ABV (46 proof).\n25 Classic Brandy Cocktails You Should Try at Least Once']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brandy-smash-classic-cocktail-759415

Serve and enjoy.\nThe Apricot Brandy\nToday\'s selection of apricot brandy offers an array of options that tend to fall into two camps: true apricot brandy and sweetened apricot brandy. The latter is technically a liqueur because of the sugars added. You will find many of these among the least expensive apricot brandies on the liquor shelf.\nFor the best Charlie Chaplin, it is recommended to seek out a true apricot brandy. These are distilled from the fruit, in the same way, that traditional brandy is distilled from grapes. They lack any additional sweeteners, and this is important. That\'s because sloe gin is a liqueur and it alone can easily take over the sweet aspect of this drink.\nYou will likely have to read the liquor labels carefully to distinguish the difference. Look for any words or phrases that indicate a sweetener or for the word ""liqueur"" anywhere on the bottle. If your only options are of the liqueur variety, opt for top-shelf options like Marie Brizard Apry or Rothman & Winter Orchard Apricot.\nThe Sloe Gin\nSloe gin is a red liqueur flavored with the sloe berry, which is naturally very tart. This flavor profile makes it an excellent liqueur option because the sweetener offsets the tartness.\nThere are some great and not-so-great sloe gins available today, so choose wisely. As with most distilled spirits, you get what you pay for. In a cocktail like this where it has equal billing with the other two ingredients, you\'ll find it best to go for quality. Look for brands like Hayman\'s, Gordon\'s, and Sipsmith.\nHow Strong Is the Charlie Chaplin?\nThe two spirits used in the Charlie Chaplin vary greatly in quality and alcohol content. That makes estimating this drink\'s strength a little more challenging than some others.\n\nTo give you a general idea, let\'s assume that the apricot brandy we\'re pouring is 60 proof and the sloe gin is 50 proof. With that, we can say that the average Charlie Chaplin falls into the 15 percent ABV (30 proof) range.

Essentially, it is a super-saturated syrup made like simple syrup, but with so much sugar that it will no longer dissolve. If you add too much sugar and allow the syrup to rest, you will have rock candy crystals form. The trick to keeping it in syrup form is finding the balance between sugar and water.\nIt may be easier to use a rich simple syrup, which can quickly be made at home. Otherwise, syrup brands like Amoretti make a great rock candy syrup that you can use in the French Pearl.\nHow Strong Is the French Pearl?\nDespite the absinthe, this is not a terribly strong cocktail because it is such a small pour. When made according to the recipe, the French Pearl has an alcohol content around 23 percent ABV (46 proof).\nDeciphering Pernod Absinthe\nThe absinthe ingredient can be a bit confusing because of the histories of the Pernod brand and absinthe. To help you out when looking for a bottle, here\'s the story in brief.\nThe name ""Pernod"" has been in the world of absinthe since the Pontarlier, France distillery opened in 1805. It was started by Henri Louis-Pernod and was one of the leading absinthes on the market through the 19th century. \nIn 1915, the first ban of absinthe was instituted because grand wormwood (the key ingredient) was thought to cause hallucinations. This shook up the absinthe market, which had moved beyond France to all parts of the world. Distillers like Pernod were forced to make some tough decisions.\nLike many of their competitors, Pernod turned to creating a pastis that would replace the beloved absinthe. Pastis are anise-flavored liqueurs that are sweetened and often bottled at a lower 40 percent ABV (80 proof). They are a favorite aperitif in France and many other countries where the distinct flavor of anise is coveted.\nPernod\'s pastis was first released in 1922 and became known simply as Pernod. It has made a few changes over the years, but is a 40 percent ABV liqueur that is sweetened, flavored with star anise, and has a yellow hue. Like the absinthe it was meant to replace, it too clouds up when water is added.\nFast forward to the end of the 20th century when wormwood was found to not be as harmful as previously thought. In the late 1980s, Europe started allowing wormwood spirits, the U.S. lifted its absinthe ban in 2007, and France followed in 2011.\nThis quickly led Pernod (now owned by the Pernod-Ricard company. Ricard is another popular pastis) to revive their absinthe. It too has seen a few variations, including Pernod Absinthe Sup?rieure which contained some artificial coloring and was not to the liking of absinthe enthusiasts.\nIn 2013, Pernod Absinthe \'Original Recipe\' was released and is from an 1890s recipe for the company\'s absinthe. The green color now comes from green nettles macerated in a wine-based distillate. As The Wormwood Society points out, this is not the first \'original\' recipe, which makes Pernod even more confusing.\nBoth Pernod and Pernod Absinthe are available in various international markets. They do a fair job of acting as substitutes for one another, though it\'s important to remember that absinthe is not sweetened and there is a noticeable difference in taste.\nWhen looking at bottles with the Pernod label, be sure to look for the word Absinthe. If the label does not have that, then you are looking at the pastis. Also, the pastis is 40 percent ABV while the absinthe is bottled at 68 percent ABV, which is another big difference.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/french-pearl-cocktail-recipe-760081

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf sweetened condensed milk is too rich for your taste, use one of the more common dairy cocktail ingredients as a substitute. Milk or cream are good choices, or you can split the difference and use half and half.\nSince Bacardi created this recipe, it is the recommended brand. Any rum will do. Typically, you\'ll want to stick with a light (or white) rum.\nA chilled cocktail glass will make this drink more enjoyable. If you don\'t have one pre-chilled, place a couple of ice cubes in the glass while you shake up the drink. Discard it before straining.\nRecipe Variation\nIs there an original dulce de leche cocktail or was it simply the playwrights\' creative license? This question has a bit of a mystery behind it and it was revived along with the musical. Bartending guides from the 1950s make no mention of it. However, Eric Felton, author of the 2007 book ""How\'s Your Drink?"" (an in-depth look at the history of some iconic cocktails), did some digging into it for The Wall Street Journal.\nFelton was able to find a similar cocktail called the Doncellita (Spanish for ""little lady"" or ""maiden""?a rough translation). It was popular in 1950\'s Havana and is simply 2 ounces of cr?me de cacao topped with 1/2 ounce of heavy cream then adorned with a cherry. There\'s no shaking or mixing, but you will need to pour the cream over the chocolate liqueur using a bar spoon to ensure it floats.\nHow Strong Is a Dulce de Leche?\nAs Sarah Brown quickly discovered, the dulce de leche is not a weak drink. When made with the recommended spirits, it shakes up to about 19 percent ABV (38 proof). While that\'s normal for martini-style drinks, the sweet ""milkshake"" taste can trick you into drinking one too many.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/dulce-de-leche-recipe-760513

This will prevent the flesh from turning brown as it is exposed to oxygen and ensure your cocktail looks fabulous while you enjoy it.\nYou can make your own raspberry-infused vermouth. The sweet taste of raspberries is perfect for a dry vermouth base and the infusion should take about one week, though you will want to test its taste periodically. Be sure to use a fine strainer or double strain it to ensure you remove all the tiny seeds.\nDry vermouth will also do just fine in the recipe. Muddle a few raspberries before adding the other ingredients to bring that flavor back.\nThe Whiskey\nSome apple whiskeys are made from real apples. When used, it has an amazing flavor that is perfect for mixing into cocktails. Be careful when searching for apple whiskeys, however. The flavored whiskey market is littered with whiskeys that are either too sweet or unnaturally flavored and more like a liqueur than a whiskey. This cocktail deserves a true apple whiskey.\nDIY Apple Whiskey\nAnother option that ensures you get a great naturally flavored apple whiskey is to infuse it yourself. You can choose any whiskey you like, though it would be best with one that is smooth and not too robust so the apple flavor can shine. Good candidates would be a blended whiskey, like those from Canada, any softer bourbons, or even an Irish whiskey.\nFor whiskey, red apples would be a good choice. Cut them into chunks or wedges so they fit inside your infusion container. The apple infusion should take about one week, after which you'll want to taste it to see if the flavor has reached your desired intensity. Go longer if you like, testing it again every couple days. \nHow Strong Is a Rustic Manhattan?\nThe rustic Manhattan is comparable in strength to other variations on the Manhattan.

Plan ahead because it requires at least one hour to steep and cool.\nIf you're going to use a substitute for Roca Patron, be sure it's also a top-shelf tequila. As with all made-from-scratch margaritas, pouring a low-quality tequila will throw the drink off balance and degrade the taste.\nTo create candied lavender for the garnish, simply use the basic candied flowers technique with sprigs of lavender. It requires egg white, water, and sugar and up to 24 hours to dry.\nAs an alternative, you could rim your glass with an easy lavender sugar or simply float a sprig of lavender on your drink.\nRecipe Variations\nUse blanco tequila if you prefer. It will not have the same oak undertones as reposado but will make a great lavender margarita. For even more aged flavors, try this cocktail with a?ejo tequila.\nIf you really love lavender, try infusing into your tequila rather than a syrup. Lavender-infused tequila should take a few days to fully develop its flavor and would be best with blanco tequila. In this case, use a plain simple syrup or replace the syrup with triple sec.\nRosemary is always a wonderful complement to lavender, so add that herb into any of your infusions for a very floral tequila cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Trophy Margarita?\nRoca Patron is bottled at 84 proof, so it's a little strong than the average tequila.

For instance, choose a dry pinot grigio for the still wine and a sweet sparkling ros?. Or, go with a sweet still moscato paired with a brut (dry) Champagne.\nRos? wines naturally have a subtle strawberry flavor, so going with that style for one of the wines is a great fit for this recipe.\nBe sure to rinse the strawberries to remove any debris.\nCut off the stems and slice each berry into thirds to make them easier to muddle.\nRecipe Variation\nUse other types of fruits to create a personal bowler. A mix of raspberries and blackberries is fun, blueberries are a natural fit, and tropical fruits like mango and papaya can be muddled as well. You can even use melons or pineapple. Essentially, it's a fantastic choice for any seasonal fruit, so have fun with it.\nHow Strong Is a Champagne Bowler?\nIt's interesting to discover that the Champagne bowler ends up just as strong as the wines you pour into it.

Before laying it on the rim, give the twist a gentle squeeze to express the peel's oils into the cocktail for a beautiful accent.\nRecipe Variations\nTry this cocktail with dry vermouth if you cannot find Cinzano Bianco. You'll find that the orange liqueur sweetens this variation delightfully well.\nThis is also an excellent option for other real fruit brandies. Standard brandy is made from grapes, though other fruits like apple, apricot, and cherry are available as well and will put a nice, fruity twist on the Fabiola. The trick to maintaining the drink's balance is to use an eau de vie, brandy that is not sweetened; many of the non-grape flavored brandies include sugar, technically making them liqueurs. Read the labels and choose wisely.\nGrand Marnier has a brandy base, so it's a natural choice for this cocktail. A worthy substitute is the Italian Gran Gala. If you're going to substitute it with another orange liqueur, be sure to keep quality in mind.\nHow Strong Is a Fabiola Cocktail?\nLike most liquor-only, martini-style drinks, the Fabiola is a potent little cocktail. When made with the recommended brands (keep in mind that Grand Marnier is the same strength as brandy, at 80 proof), it mixes up to 26 percent ABV (52 proof). That's one reason why it's barely a three-ounce drink.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/fabiola-cocktail-recipe-759432

Stir well.\nAdd ice and stir for one minute.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nSqueeze an orange peel over the drink, making sure the oils fall into the glass, then drop the peel into the drink. Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou may have noticed that the vermouth outweighs the other two ingredients. This is how Pernod designed the recipe, and it works very well. A drink that is this heavy on the vermouth is going to have a much drier profile than most. This makes it an ideal choice for a dinner cocktail, especially when served as an aperitif.\nFor some tastes, even a 1/4-ounce pour may be a little too much absinthe. It's a very powerful flavor that can be rather surprising if you're not used to it. You may want to take that down a bit when mixing up the next round or simply begin with a little less than recommended right from the start.\nSince this cocktail is so clean and heavy on the alcohol, it's important to choose quality ingredients. If you haven't already, consider upgrading your vermouth?and ensure it's fresh?as well as the brandy. This is a nice use for small-batch brandies, cognac, or Armagnac.\nWhile it's designed to be served up, the chrysanthemum is a good drink to serve on the rocks. As the ice melts the flavors will mellow out slightly and create a wonderful sipper that you can enjoy slowly.\nHow Strong Is the Chrysanthemum?\nAny alcohol-only cocktail is going to be on the strong side and this one is on the lower end of that spectrum. All the stirring does dilute it considerably, but that does more for marrying the flavors than anything else. However, the excess vermouth helps bring it down considerably.\n\nPernod is bottled at 136 proof and, with an 80-proof brandy, the drink comes out to around 22 percent ABV (44 proof). In comparison, the average Manhattan weighs in around 60 proof.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/chrysanthemum-cocktail-recipe-759422

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe best martinis are made with the best gin, so be sure to pour a premium brand. Customarily, it\'s made with a London dry gin, though there are many fascinating dry gins available that don\'t fall under that label.\nIt\'s also a fabulous recipe for gin experiments. If you spot an unfamiliar brand and it piques your interest, give it a try and see how it stands up to vermouth.\nThe quality of the vermouth should match the gin. More importantly, make sure that your dry vermouth is fresh because it doesn\'t have the long shelf life of distilled spirits. Over time once it\'s exposed to air, the fortified wine will begin to lose its botanical flavor and become stale. If a bottle\'s been open for more than three months and has not been stored in the refrigerator, it\'s time to replace it.\nIt may just be an old bar superstition, but it\'s said that an even number of olives in a martini is bad luck. Stick with one or three olives if you don\'t want to test that theory!\nRecipe Variation\nAn old recipe called the ""allies cocktail"" is very similar to this one and has a World War II theme. It\'s a mix of equal parts London dry gin and French (dry) vermouth with 2 dashes of Russian kummel, an obscure caraway, cumin, and fennel liqueur.\nHaving a few friends over for martinis? Mix this cocktail up in a martini pitcher. The tall, thin pitchers are designed specifically for the purpose of stirring up martinis with ice. They vary in size, typically from 25 ounces to 64 ounces, and some even come with an appropriately sized Hawthorne strainer.\nHow Strong Is a 50-50 Martini?\nAs with all martinis, this is a very strong cocktail. It may look all fancy and genteel, but it\'s potent and will typically mix up to an alcohol content around 24 percent ABV (48 proof). While it\'s not the potential 62 proof of a dry martini, you will notice the effect if you knock back two or more in one night.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/50-50-gin-martini-recipe-759550

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\n""Dump"" the whiskey? Yeah right! Instead of wasting good whiskey, go ahead and drink the excess or reserve it in a shot glass for later. Also, if you\'re making a few Irish martinis, the same 1/2 ounce can be transferred to each glass.\nA chilled glass makes this drink just a little better. If you don\'t have room in your freezer for a couple of cocktail glasses, take the quick approach instead. Simply fill the glass with a few ice cubes while you gather the ingredients and tools, then dump them out right before doing the whiskey rinse.\nMake sure your vermouth is fresh because stale vermouth makes a bad martini. The fortified wine has a short shelf life of just three months after the bottle is open. It should also be stored in the refrigerator.\nRecipe Variations\nRather than vodka, try the Irish martini with gin. The extra flavor from that spirit\'s botanicals is really interesting with an Irish whiskey kiss.\nYou can also try this recipe with scotch. It will be a little different than the smoky martini, which uses just a dash of the whisky as a modifier instead of vermouth. Try blended scotch rather than really smoky single malts.\nHow Strong Is an Irish Martini?\nAs with any of the alcohol-only martinis, do not expect this to be a light drink! If you take into account that full pour of whiskey, the Irish martini\'s alcohol content is a whopping 31 percent ABV (62 proof). That\'s right in line with the gin and vodka martinis, as well as the whiskey Manhattan.

The dual citrus is nice and the drink is delightful when you squeeze the lime wedge into it. However, if you want to save fruit, it will be just as good with a lemon wedge.\nThere should be no problems with Averna floating on top of the drink. Just pour slowly using a spoon to break up the flow and the layer should form naturally.\nFor the ginger ale, consider picking up one that is produced by a craft soda company. You will find that drinks which rely as heavily on soda as this one are best with brands like Q Drinks or Fever-Tree, both of which were designed specifically for cocktails.\nIf you're going top-shelf on the other ingredients, it only makes sense to use fresh lemon juice. You can expect to get 1 3/4 ounces out of the average lemon, so one fruit should be enough for a small dinner party.\nRecipe Variations\nFeel free to try this cocktail with other amaros. Each will have its own flavor contributed by their proprietary blend of herbs, spices, and fruits and most should float relatively well. Look for bottles like Amaro Ramazzotti, Amaro Ciociaro, and Amaro Montenegro.\nIf you prefer, pour another clear soda?keeping quality in mind for the best tasting drink. You might enjoy the vertigo better with club soda or a citrus soda, for instance.\nHow Strong Is a Vertigo Cocktail?\nAverna is bottled at 29 percent ABV and this drink includes a good deal of ginger ale, so it's pretty light.

The egg white adds a lovely texture that is common in classic fizz drinks. It's a good drink is good without it, but it does make a more luscious cocktail.\nEnsure that your egg is fresh by giving it a quick test: Place the egg in a glass of water and if it sinks, it's fresh. Eggs that float should be discarded.\nLavender simple syrup is very easy to make at home. All you need is sugar, water, and lavender buds; it takes about 2 hours, including the time required for the syrup to cool.\nSyrup companies like Monin, Torani, and Sonoma offer a lavender syrup as well.\nGood garnish options include a few pomegranate seeds (arils), a sprig of lavender, or a lime twist.\nRecipe Variations\nPomegranate juice is a good substitute for the liqueur. Grenadine will likely be too sweet, unless it's homemade.\nYou could also muddle about 15 fresh pomegranate arils in the shaker when the fruit is in season. That is typically early to mid-winter, making it an excellent option for holiday cocktails.\nRosemary simple syrup is a good alternative to lavender. The herb also pairs nicely with pomegranate and all you need to do is substitute it for lavender in the syrup recipe.\nTop the drink with your favorite lightly flavored soda. Ginger ale and lemon-lime sodas are good choices, though you can go with something unique like dry sparkling lavender or rhubarb.\nMake this a nonalcoholic drink by skipping the gin and pouring pomegranate juice. Alternatively, mix up a holiday pomegranate mojito.\nHow Strong Is a Pomegranate Gin Fizz?\nThe pomegranate gin fizz has an alcohol content similar to other highballs. It's relatively gentle in the cocktail world, weighing in somewhere around 13 percent ABV (26 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\n\nTo Make the Lavender Honey\nThe lavender honey is very easy to make and this recipe takes a different approach to the typical lavender-flavored syrup. Instead of using fresh or dried lavender buds, it mixes a brewed lavender tea (technically an herbal tisane) with equal parts honey.\nIt's a very simple way to get nearly the same taste, though it's important to note that many 'lavender teas' are not solely lavender. If you buy it in tea bag form, you might also get some green or black tea or other herbs like chamomile included in the mix. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it will only add to the flavor.\nFor a pure lavender tisane experience, simply steep whole lavender buds in hot water using a mesh tea strainer or fill-your-own tea bag.\nTo make the lavender honey, brew 1 cup of lavender tea. Combine this with 1 cup honey and stir until well mixed.\nTo Make the Blueberry Shrub\nThe blueberry shrub is a fun flavored drinking vinegar that is quite easy to make. This one begins with fresh berries and apple cider vinegar and you will need to give it at least 2 days for the flavors to infuse. \nWhen your shrub is done, you will be ready to mix up the Daiquir-ease. You can also use it in other cocktails to add an interesting twist. Any shrub can be enjoyed on its own as well and this one is fantastic with club soda or ginger ale.\nIn a jar with a tight-sealing lid, place 1 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries into 1 1/2 cups apple cider vinegar.\nCover, shake well and let sit for 2 days. Give the jar a good shake at least once a day.\nTaste the shrub and infuse for longer if needed and until you get your ideal blueberry flavor. Once that is done, strain out the berries.\nPlace the shrub into a small saucepan and gently heat (do not boil).\nTurn off the heat and add 2 tablespoons of agave nectar, mixing well. Taste and add more nectar if you like though keep in mind that you do want a certain amount of bitterness.\nAllow the shrub to cool and store in a well-sealed bottle.\nHow Strong Is the Daiquir-ease?\nThe Daiquir-ease is a very mild and lovely cocktail and it's one that you can enjoy anytime without fear of getting too loopy. The majority of the drink is made with non-alcoholic mixers, so it has an alcohol content of just around 11 percent ABV (22 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/daiquir-ease-cocktail-blueberry-lavender-daiquiri-760453

Serve and enjoy.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk for food-borne illness.\nTips\nThe key to drinking cocktails with eggs is to ensure your egg is fresh. There's a quick test you can use: Place an egg in a glass of water and it's freshest when it sinks to the bottom. If your egg floats it's too old and should be discarded.\nTake it easy on the cilantro. It's a very flavorful herb and even a couple of extra leaves can overpower the drink. If you like, start with just four leaves and add more next time if needed.\nWith all the fresh ingredients, this cocktail really deserves freshly squeezed lime juice. The average lime can yield up to 1 ounce of juice, so one fruit is generally all that's needed.\nTo maximize the juice, warm the lime to room temperature and roll it under your palm on the countertop before cutting.\nRecipe Variations\nSkip the egg white if you prefer.\nIf you're not a fan of cilantro, replace it with oregano or basil.\nAs seen in the spicy cucumber mint margarita, mint is a good match for cucumber as well. Though it's not as savory as the other herbs and will change the cocktail's overall taste, it is a good option for this recipe.\nCucumber and chile peppers are an excellent pairing as well. Add a few slices of jalape?o to the muddle to give the margarita a spicy kick.\nHow Strong Is El Pepino?\nEl pepino is not as strong as other shaken margaritas. Instead, its alcohol content is similar to a glass of wine and much of that is due to the added volume of the egg.

The trick to layering it is to pour it over the back of a spoon, which disrupts the liquid's flow and evenly distributes it on top. This is a great drink to practice the bartending skill.\nFresh orange juice will create a better tasting drink. Typically, you can get 3 ounces of juice from a single orange, so squeeze two fruits and you'll have enough for a couple of drinks.\nThis drink doesn't require your best tequila, so it's okay to pour a mid-range brand. Customarily, a blanco (silver) tequila is used, but if you're using fresh juice, a reposado tequila is a really nice pairing with the golden liqueur.\nRecipe Variations\nTequila and grapefruit are a great match. If you like, switch the orange juice for grapefruit juice. It will not be the authentic Freddy Fuddpucker, but it will be a rather tasty drink.\nOther vanilla liqueurs may be used as a substitute for Galliano, but it will not have the full herbal blend of that liqueur. It's also likely that a substitute will have a slightly different specific gravity and that means it may not float as well. However, you can try liqueurs like Giffard Vanille de Madagascar or Tuaca in this cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Freddie Fuddpucker?\nThe Freddy Fuddpucker has a lot of orange juice, so it's a surprisingly light drink.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nStart with a smaller amount of olive juice then add more if you would like. It's a tricky flavor, especially with tequila, and you will likely need to make adjustments with different tequilas.\nWhile bitters can often be optional in martinis, it is essential in this recipe. The orange bitters add a much-needed accent that marries the aged tequila and olive flavors together.\nThe old bar debate of shaken versus stirred applies to the dirty tequini as well. It is made primarily of liquor, so stirring would be the preferred mixing method. However, you may enjoy it shaken because the extra agitation will break up the ice more and soften the flavors.\nRecipe Variations\nThere is a difference between olive brine and olive juice, though the names are often used interchangeably. Rather than pouring the brine from a jar of olives, try this cocktail with a dedicated olive juice. Some companies make the juice specifically for dirty martinis.\nYou can explore different types of tequila as well. The flavor of blanco (or silver) tequila might be a little too transparent for some tastes, but it's worth a try. If you go the other way, you'll find that the extra oak flavor a?ejo tequilas can be really nice against the olive flavor.\nIf you really want a punch of flavor, try this cocktail with mezcal. Make sure it's a premium brand, but that extra smokiness can be very interesting in this recipe.\nHow Strong Is a Dirty Tequila Martini?\nLike most martinis, the dirty tequila martini is a pretty strong cocktail, which is why it's served at just under 4 ounces.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIn keeping with Square One\'s organic roots, it would be best to choose organic vegetables and herbs for the ultimate ""green"" cocktail.\nChoose pieces of celery that are closer to the heart because it is sweeter and better for cocktails like this.\nFor cocktails, the English cucumber is always a good choice. This variety has smaller seeds and that reduces the bitterness, leading to a sweeter cucumber flavor.\nWith all these fresh ingredients, it\'s definitely recommended to use fresh-squeezed lemon juice. You can typically expect to get 1 3/4 ounces of juice from the average lemon, which is more than enough for one drink.\nRecipe Variations\nNot everyone is a fan of cilantro, though it really does give the drink a nice kick. Add a little less if you prefer.\nIn keeping with the Pimm\'s Cup, you could top this drink off with lemonade (the original recipe); freshly squeezed is best. Try it with lemonade and club soda, which is a popular variation. Ginger ale is a common substitute, creating a Pimm\'s Rangoon, and Champagne is a good option for a version called the Pimm\'s Royal.\nThis cocktail would be an excellent use for homemade cucumber vodka. The infusion should take about three days to reach its peak flavor. You\'ll want to remove the cucumber\'s skin and English cucumber is your best option.\nHow Strong Is a Celery Cup No. 1?\nEstimating the alcohol content of this cocktail requires concentrating on the liquid ingredients. While the muddle will add to the volume, it\'s difficult to say exactly what that will yield and it will vary. With that in mind, the celery cup should weigh in just shy of 17 percent ABV (34 proof) when mixed according to the recipe. That\'s perfectly normal for a tall drink.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/celery-cup-no-1-cocktail-760944

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nThe Wine. When it comes to choosing the wine for the Elderflower Cocktail, you have a number of options. Because of the liqueur\'s sweetness, it is often best to choose a dry Champagne (those marked ""Brut""). If you like, switch to another sparkling wine like Italy\'s Prosecco or Spain\'s Cava.\nWe are also adding soda to this cocktail, which means that your wine does not have to sparkle. Instead, you can choose a dry white wine such as a Pinot Grigio, Riesling, or Sauvignon Blanc.\nThe Elderflower Liqueur. Prior to the 2007 release of St. Germain Liqueur, we needed to make our own elderflower cordial for this cocktail. While St. Germain makes the drink even easier to make, you can revert to the old ways and take on this fun DIY project anyway.\nElderflower cordial is a favorite in the U.K. because the islands are plentiful with the flowers in spring. If you\'re lucky enough to have elderflower in your area, harvest the blossoms (you\'ll need a lot) and use this recipe to make a non-alcoholic elderflower cordial at home. Spike it with a little vodka if you like.\nVariations\nYou can make an elderflower liqueur by starting with a flower-infused simple syrup. Add this to your favorite vodka and play around with the syrup to liquor ratio until you get a nice, soft, floral flavor with just a hint of sweetness.\nAnother option is to infuse the vodka directly with elderflower then add simple syrup to sweeten it. However, many people have not had as much success with this approach.\nA Non-Alcoholic Variation. If you would like to serve the same drink to guests who are skipping alcohol, it\'s very easy. Simply begin with an alcohol-free elderflower cordial or syrup and top it with club soda or ginger ale.\nHow Strong Is the Elderflower Cocktail with Champagne?\nThe elderflower cocktail is a delightfully light cocktail. With the addition of soda, the drink\'s strength comes back down to that of the average bottle of Champagne, despite adding a liqueur. On average, you can expect this drink to have an alcohol content of about 13 percent ABV (26 proof).\nThe Bar Glassware Tour']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/elderflower-cocktail-recipe-759653

Fill with ice.\nShake vigorously.\nStrain into a tall shot glass.\nTop with a splash of lemon-lime soda, and add a drizzle of grenadine.\nServe and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is the Wolf Bite Shooter?\nFirst of all, let's point out that Lucid Absinthe is 124 proof (or 62 percent alcohol by volume). In comparison, the average vodka, tequila, and most of the base liquors are 80 proof. It is not a weak liquor!\n\nAs tempting as it may be, never take a straight shot of absinthe. Instead, dilute it as it was meant to be. A night of straight absinthe shots is not a pretty thing.\n\nThe absinthe in the Wolf Bite is just a 1/4-ounce pour in a 2-ounce shot. This helps bring down the shot's potency to a decent 13 percent ABV (26 proof).\n\nIt will not be as strong as a straight shot of tequila and is pretty mild compared to other mixed shots. The high ratio of pineapple juice helps keep this one nice and mellow, which is surprising.\nTips\nThe grenadine drizzle does not have to be perfect. It will act exactly as it does in a Tequila Sunrise and sink to the bottom of the glass. There's no need to try and float it because the syrup is heavier than the green liquid.\nA tall shot glass is essential. Most of the small shot glasses will hold just over an ounce and this recipe creates a 2-ounce shot. The tall glass will also make the visual effect more appealing.\nInstead of buying a large can or bottle of pineapple juice, get a pack of small cans (typically 6 ounces each). This allows you to open a single can while pouring your shots and avoids wasting a lot of juice.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/wolf-bite-shot-recipe-759565

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nKeep in mind that a snifter is a very large glass and it's not meant to be filled. Instead, the ice and liquids should not exceed half the volume (one-third of the volume is ideal). This allows the drink's aroma to swirl inside the empty portion, which adds to the experience.\nFor the best drink, ensure that the liqueur matches the quality of your gin. Top-shelf amarettos like Disaronno would be an excellent choice, though there are other fine almond liqueurs worth exploring.\nThe bitters are not defined in this recipe; the most natural choice would be aromatic bitters, such as Angostura. Do experiment with other flavors; orange bitters will add a nice citrus accent while floral herbal bitters (e.g., lavender or chamomile) could really play nicely off the gin's botanicals.\nIf your only option for maraschino cherries is the neon red cherries that are so common, skip the garnish or go with a citrus twist instead. Those cherries are essentially bleached and dyed?anything but natural?and can quickly bring this drink down. During cherry season, you can make your own maraschinos to keep on hand for drinks like this.\nRecipe Variation\nA splash of hot water creates a toddy-like drink and the warmth opens up the drink's aroma in a lovely and very comforting way. It's reminiscent of the gin toddy, though amaretto is a very nice touch to that recipe as well.\nHow Strong Is a Tanqueray Almond?\nTanqueray is bottled at 94.6 proof, so this is not a light drink. It should mix up to an alcohol content around 30 percent ABV (60 proof). That's partially why it's served short; the other reason is that it's meant to be sipped slowly like a fine brandy.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tanqueray-almond-cocktail-recipe-760126

Fill with ice.\nShake well.\nStrain into a highball glass over fresh ice.\nGarnish with an orange slice.\nRecipe Variations\nThis recipe can easily be increased to fill a punch bowl or pitcher so you can serve it at a party. The key is to keep the ratio of 2 parts tequila, 1 part each orange liqueur, limoncello, and sour mix, and 1/4 part orange juice.\nFor instance, you could begin with half a bottle of tequila (375 milliliters or about 1 1/2 cups) for your 2 parts. That will leave you with about 3/4 cup each for the 1 part ingredients and?to make the math easy?1/4 cup of orange juice. This results in a 4 cup or 32-ounce punch. Serve this over ice and you can get eight 4-ounce drinks, perfect for a small gathering.\nIf you have more guests, simply increase the punch measurements to fit. Keep in mind, though, that this is a very strong punch. It's not a bad idea to dilute it a bit with nonalcoholic mixers so your guests don't get too drunk too fast:\nAdd Ice: When serving the devil's punch in a punch bowl, you won't shake it, so you won't have the dilution of the single cocktail. Dilution is good because it brings the strength and marries the flavors. You can get a good amount of dilution over time by adding a lot of ice cubes or letting your punch rest after adding a large ice ring or big blocks. Within 30 minutes of setting it out on the table, it should be about perfect.\nAdd Orange Juice: Increasing the orange juice a little bit will add flavor and knock the punch down as well. It will still taste great, even if you were to double the juice. Add it slowly to the punch, stir it in, and give it a taste, pouring a little more if needed.\nAdd Sparkle: Club soda, ginger ale, or lemon-lime soda are fantastic additions to any punch. People love sparkling punches and the easiest way to cut the liquor's effects without altering the taste is to pour one of those sodas. Start off with an amount equal to the orange juice and add more if needed.\nHow Strong Is a Devil's Punch?\nThis punch really does live up to its name because it's rather potent. When made with 80-proof tequila, the single drink mixes up to an alcohol content around 26 percent ABV (52 proof). That's in the same range as the original margarita, so it's best to take it easy with this little devil!""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/devils-punch-recipe-760813

Not only can you make your own syrup and vodka, you can even make amaretto. The recipe for homemade amaretto requires a few basic ingredients and takes about 20 minutes. There's no waiting for an infusion, either, so it will be ready by the time your spiced syrup is.\nFor the pear vodka infusion, use the techniques in this apple-pear gin. Simply skip the apples and use three pears. Have fun mixing pear varieties to create your own custom flavor. This infusion will take at least one week, though it may need to go longer?possibly as many as three weeks?to reach your ideal flavor.\nIf you're going with made-from-scratch ingredients, you might as well use fresh lemon juice too. It's always the best option for creating better tasting cocktails and will improve the flavor of your peartini.\nPears are just like apples when it comes to garnishes. Once you cut the fruit, the flesh will begin to brown as it's exposed to oxygen. To keep your garnishes looking fresh, give them a quick dunk in lemon juice right after cutting the slices. Shake off the excess, cut a small slit so it fits on the glass rim, and pour your drink.\nHow Strong Is the Peartini?\nWhile many martinis are primarily made of alcohol and can be quite strong, this is not the case with the peartini. That's because flavored vodkas are generally just 35 percent ABV (70 proof), amaretto is usually around 21 percent ABV, and the rest of the drink is made up of nonalcoholic mixers.\n\nOn average, you can expect that your peartini has an alcohol content around 19 percent ABV (38 proof).

They both have star anise flavor and a deep red color, which contributes greatly to the pink outcome of the cocktail. \nIn case you have trouble locating Angostura ¡°Cocoa¡± Bitters, you can substitute with any bitters that have a chocolate flavor.\nEl Guapo Candy Cane syrup can easily be found online. But the best substitute is Rumple Minze Peppermint Liqueur.\nYou can use any non-dairy milk to balance out the richness from the heavy cream.\nIf lactose intolerant, just use more non-dairy milk instead of heavy cream.\nTen to One Light Rum is best for this recipe.\nNon-Alcoholic Candy Cane Punch\nIf you would like to make a non-alcoholic version of this cocktail, follow the same recipe but make the following adjustments:\nReplace Peychaud¡¯s bitters with non-alcoholic Creole bitters.\nReplace Angostura Cocoa bitters with Fee Brothers Aztec Chocolate Bitters.\nReplace Campari with Stirrings Blood Orange Bitters.\nReplace light rum with Lyre¡¯s White Cane Non-alcoholic spirit.\nMake It a Gift\nThis cocktail also makes for a fun gift. Use a funnel to pour the punch into a clean bottle, seal well, and tie on a colorful ribbon with a candy cane. Attach a note reminding the recipient to keep it refrigerated.\nHow to Store\nBe sure to refrigerate in a tightly-sealed container or pitcher (use plastic wrap, if possible).  Try not to store for more than 2 weeks.  Always stir before serving.\n\nIf you need to store for longer you can keep it in a freezer for up to a month.  Fit a freezer bag inside a large measuring cup or pitcher and pour in the punch. Seal tightly, remove from the cup or pitcher, and place inside a second bag, then place in the freezer. Allow to thaw in the refrigerator for 24 hours before serving.\nHow Strong Is a Candy Cane Punch?\n\nSome rum is 80-proof, and others are over-proof.  So, depending on the alcohol percentage of the rum you choose, this cocktail should be between 8-10% alcohol by volume.\nChocolate Bitters Recipe']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/candy-cane-punch-5205408

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWhile there are other colors of cura?ao available?clear (called ""orange"") and green?the look of the jellyfish cocktail relies on the blue-colored liqueur.\nYou can also find blue cura?ao in a nonalcoholic syrup. Just be aware that this may have a different specific gravity than the liqueur and may not create very distinct layers.\nSambuca is an anise-flavored liqueur that is often compared to the taste of black licorice. It also comes in different colors?primarily clear (called ""white"") and black?with the white being the most popular and common.\nThe heavier the cream you use, the more distinct the jellyfish effect will be. Heavy whipping cream is the thickest available and is an excellent choice because it will barely mix in with the rest of the drink. A standard cream or half and half would be good as well. You\'ll find that milk is too thin and will likely blend right in.\nAs for the vodka, go ahead and use your favorite ""well"" brand. The jellyfish is designed to be more of a novelty drink than anything else and there\'s really no need to pour your best vodka with all these flavors. That said, you\'ll find it best to choose a clean tasting vodka; there are quite a few worthy brands that remain very affordable.\nRecipe Variation\nBlack sambuca could be a very interesting twist in the jellyfish because it offers a great contrast to the white cream. It would be a fun substitute for Halloween parties.\nHow Strong Is a Jellyfish Cocktail?\nThe jellyfish is fun, funky, and surprisingly strong. Even with the cream, the three liquors add up to an average alcohol content of 28 percent ABV (56 proof). That\'s hefty for a highball drink, so as tempting as it may be to have a few rounds, you\'re taking a chance on getting schnockered.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/jellyfish-cocktail-recipe-761085

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nPreheating your glass will keep this toddy warmer longer. You can do this by simply filling the glass or mug with hot water for a few minutes or by heating the water-filled glass in the microwave for about 10 seconds.\nWhile you could use triple sec, cura?ao, or other orange liqueurs, the toddy's flavor won't have the same depth as one made with the darker brandy-based options.\nFresh-squeezed lime juice is preferred and you should be able to make two to four toddies from a single fruit. Rather than getting out a juicer, you can simply squeeze the juice of half a lime into your drink.\nSave some of the lime for the garnish. As with the gin and tonic, wiping the rim of your glass with the citrus adds an extra zing to the flavor when you go to take a drink.\nRecipe Variations\nThe rum you choose to pour will greatly affect the taste of your toddy. White rums will be soft and let the citrus shine, while aged rums offer some extra flavors and really do produce the best grand rum toddy. If you prefer, spiced rum can be nice here as well.\nAs with any hot toddy, you can brew your favorite tea for this recipe and use it instead of plain water. Try a tea that's lighter in flavor, such as a green tea. A citrus or relaxing bedtime herbal blend work well, too. Avoid anything with mint or other bold flavors that will contrast with the toddy's citrus.\nIf you want a little extra sweetness, add a teaspoon of honey, agave nectar, or simple syrup. Flavored simple syrups can add a nice spice at the same time. Try a cinnamon syrup, vanilla syrup, or ginger syrup, all of which are incredibly easy (and cheap) to make at home.\nHow Strong Is a Hot Toddy?\nAs with most hot toddies, this recipe is mild when it comes to the alcohol content. It's not weak and still has a lot of flavors, but the alcohol isn't overpowering. On average, the grand rum toddy weighs in around 11 percent ABV (22 proof). It's perfectly relaxing and a lot like enjoying a glass of wine, only it's warm and toasty.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/grand-rum-toddy-760524

Enjoy.\nWhat Is Lychee Syrup?\nA lychee is a small tropical fruit that tastes like a cross between strawberries and watermelon. They\'re quite delicious and a fantastic way to make a tropical cocktail. \nWhen it comes to the syrup, you have the choice to buy or DIY. Syrup brands like Monin and Torani make a nice lychee syrup. If you can\'t find them at your local stores, they are available online.\nThe other option is to make your own lychee syrup, and it\'s just as easy as any other simple syrup. You simply need the white, fleshy fruits. You can often find these canned at Asian markets or sections in the grocery store, though sometimes you can even find whole, fresh lychee. You will have to remove the stone, and there are a few tricks that will help you out with that.\nDon\'t Get Too Spicy\nIt can be easy to add too much spice to drinks that include hot peppers. Even if you enjoy all things hot and spicy, it\'s best to proceed with caution when adding jalapenos to this margarita. After all, you want to be able to taste the drink, and that\'s not possible if you burn your tongue.\nStick with the recommended number of pepper slices. The longer they sit in the pitcher, the more pepper flavor will be infused into the drink. To reduce the heat, remove as much of the white membrane as possible because this is where most of the pepper\'s capsaicin lies.\nAlso, be sure to remove the seeds as they can be quite annoying in a cocktail. They hold no spice and do little in the flavor department.\nWith careful attention to how you prep the pepper, The Late Night Lychee can be a well-balanced drink. Remember to wash your hands after handling jalapenos. Few things ruin a party faster than a little pepper burn.\nWant to Make a Single Drink?\nTransforming this recipe from a pitcher into a single serving could not be easier. Simply replace the word ""cups"" with ""ounces"" for the liquid ingredients, and you\'ll have a nice 3- to 4-ounce drink when the ice is factored in. Reduce the peppers to just one or two slices and the cilantro to one or two sprigs as well.\nHow Strong Is The Late Night Lychee?\nThis cocktail gets a considerable amount of dilution by the time you drink it. Not only does ice get stirred into the drink, but it\'s also used in each glass. That helps tame and marry the flavors and brings the alcohol content down a bit. \n\nThough it will vary, we can estimate that this drink weighs in somewhere around 18 percent ABV (36 proof). It\'s in line with other margaritas and is poured short, so your guests shouldn\'t get drunk off one pitcher.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lychee-margarita-4138326

Add the sugar and lemon zest and whisk until the sugar is dissolved. Heat for about 5 minutes in total, then remove from heat and let the lemon syrup cool completely.\nWhile the syrup cools, juice the lemons. Remove the pulp and seeds by pouring the juice through a fine-mesh strainer. Chill until ready to make lemonade.\nBlend the lemonade in a pitcher. Add 1/2 cup of rum or vodka, 1 cup each of the lemon syrup and lemon juice, and 2 cups of cold water: stir and taste. Add more liquor, syrup, juice, and water in proportionate intervals as you fill the pitcher and adjust the sweet, sour, and strength to your taste. Chill the lemonade for at least 1 hour, or until needed.\nWhen ready to serve, pour the spiked lemonade into ice-filled glasses. Garnish with lemon slices and, if you like, seasonal fruits. Enjoy.\nTips\nThe recipe produces 2 cups of lemon syrup which is a little more than you may need for the lemonade. Store any excess in a jar or bottle in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Top it with soda for a quick homemade lemon soda. It also works as the syrup for a lemon drop martini and a sour mix substitute in cocktails.\nSix average-sized lemons yield about 1 1/2 cups of juice. It's a good idea to have a few extra lemons around so you can add more juice if needed.\nMake the lemonade's flavor a little strong because it will dilute slightly when served over ice.\nWhen the pitcher of lemonade is out of the fridge, keep it cold with large ice cubes. These will dilute more slowly than smaller pieces of ice.\nRecipe Variations\nSwitch to your favorite type of sugar; raw or coconut sugar creates a more richly flavored syrup. Agave nectar can replace the syrup, and honey syrup works well, too.\nIf you want to make a pitcher of nonalcoholic lemonade and spike it by the glass, use about 1 1/2 ounces of liquor for 4 to 5 ounces of lemonade.\nMuddle fresh berries in each glass then top it with the spiked lemonade.\nMake sparkling lemonade by topping each glass with soda water. You can add it to the pitcher but it will go flat over time; add any carbonated mixer just before serving.\nWhich Liquors Go Best With Lemonade?\nRum and vodka are the best liquors for a neutral-flavored lemonade that will appeal to various tastes. They're not your only options. As the Lynchburg lemonade and other cocktails prove, some whiskies work as well. Stick with Tennessee whiskey, bourbon, or blended whiskey; scotch is not a great choice unless it's in a more complex mix like the witch hunt. Tequila will work, but you might want to switch to limeade or a mix of lemon and lime juices. Liqueurs are another option: Try a brandy-based orange liqueur (e.g., Grand Marnier) or split the main liquor with hazelnut liqueur. For a flavored rum or vodka, all types of berries, coconut, and ginger pair best with lemons.\nHow Strong Is the Spiked Lemonade\nThis spiked lemonade is not very strong at all. If you blend a full cup of 80-proof liquor into a 60-ounce pitcher, the lemonade's alcohol content will fall around 5 percent ABV (10 proof). That's equivalent to the average beer.\n12 Fantastic Fresh Fruit Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/spiked-lemonade-recipe-5096010

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nSlowly pour the root beer and be ready to stop before the glass is completely full. Just like with ice cream, the cream will create a big foam head and can quickly overflow.\nTry different root beers as there are some fantastic options that are better for cocktails than those made by the big soda companies. Boylan, Bundaberg, Dang!, and Triple XXX are all excellent choices. You can also use a hard root beer!\nRecipe Variations\nA common adaptation of this recipe uses vodka, Galliano, cream, and cola.\nRumChata is a cream liqueur that is excellent for a root beer float. Simply use it to replace the cream. It will, however, curdle when mixed with some root beers, though the brand has found that A&W and Dad's root beers do not produce this effect.\nIf you don't have Galliano in stock, another vanilla liqueur or vanilla schnapps will do just fine. You could even simply pour a double shot of vanilla vodka instead.\nGive your float a real kick by using a vanilla-flavored whiskey or rum. Crown Royal, Jim Beam, Phillips Union, and a few other brands make vanilla whiskeys. Vanilla rum is even easier to find; look for Blue Chair, Brinley Gold, Cruzan, and Whalers (there are many more).\nIf you want to use ice cream, skip the cream and ice. Pour the liquors, add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, then slowly fill the glass with root beer.\nHow Strong Is a Spiked Root Beer Float?\nThis root beer may be spiked, but it's not much stronger than drinking a normal beer.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIt\'s customary to garnish with an odd number of olives: one large or three small. Bartenders used to say that an even number is bad luck though three skewered olives let you enjoy one at a time as you drink, finishing up just before the last sip.\nWith just three ingredients, it\'s important that you pay attention to quality if you want the best cocktail. A drink like this deserves premium gin and vermouth.\nThis is the perfect drink to use when exploring different styles and brands of gin. London dry gin is a popular choice that offers the full flavor of the spirit\'s botanicals. There are several softer gins available if you prefer something with less focus on juniper\'s ""pine"" flavor. Also, look for craft gin brands because there are many that rival the biggest brands in quality and taste.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you prefer vodka martinis, skip the gin and pour vodka in the perfect martini instead.\nTry the ""perfect"" version with other spirits, too. Both whiskey and brandy are popular foundations, though the right rum can make an interesting perfect Jean Harlow cocktail, and an aged tequila will work in a perfect tequini.\nSwitch to a cocktail onion garnish for a perfect Gibson.\nWhat\'s the Best Vermouth for a Martini?\nJust as important as your gin, the bottles of vermouth that you choose can enhance your perfect martini. It\'s tempting to discount the fortified wines and pick up inexpensive bottles, but there are some great vermouths worthy of any bar. Look for bottles such as Carpano, Cinzano, Noilly Prat, and Vya. Don\'t be afraid to explore unknown names because there are many smaller producers making some very impressive options. No matter which you choose, write the date you open it on the label. Vermouth has a shelf life of just 3 months, after which it will lose flavor and should be replaced.\nIs it Best to Shake or Stir a Martini?\nMartinis always bring up the shaken or stirred debate and most drinkers have an opinion of which method is best. Stirring gently marries the ingredients\' flavors with subtle dilution while the extra dilution of shaking relaxes the flavor and adds air. The general ""rule"" is to stir cocktails that are comprised only of liquor, saving the shake for those with nonalcoholic mixers, such as the cosmopolitan. However, as with most things in the bar, it\'s a matter of personal preference. The point is to create your ideal perfect martini because you\'re drinking it. Give both mixing methods a try and see which you prefer. Also, there may be some gins you like shaken or times when you\'re in the mood for a stirred martini. Be open and flexible, but most of all, have fun with the experience!\nHow Strong Is the Perfect Martini?\nThey may look all neat and fancy, but martinis are not weak drinks because they\'re made entirely of alcohol. With an 80-proof gin, you can expect the perfect martini to weigh in around 27 percent ABV (54 proof). After the second round, you\'ll have topped the alcohol in a straight shot of tequila.\n30 Best Martini Recipes']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/perfect-martini-recipe-759777

Whisk in the sweetener until dissolved.\nReduce to a simmer and add juice of 1/4 orange and the orange peels. Simmer for 5 minutes, then remove from the heat to cool completely before removing the peels and discarding.

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nAdjust the syrup to taste: add more orange juice for extra citrus flavor. If you include some of the white pith on the peel, it will add to the bitterness.\nTop-shelf tequila makes a better margarita. While reposado tequila is suggested because the aging adds a nice oakiness to the margarita, a blanco (or silver) tequila works just fine.\nRecipe Variations\nIf the margarita is a little too tart, add a bit more syrup next time.\nMake the syrup with orange extract instead of fresh orange juice and peel. Let it cool completely, then add about 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract, taste, and add more if needed.\nTo serve the margarita on the rocks, strain it over fresh ice into a cocktail, margarita, or old-fashioned glass.\nFor a frozen margarita, add the ingredients to a blender with 1 cup (about 5 or 6 average-sized cubes) of ice and blend well.\nAdd fruit to your margarita. The easiest way is to muddle fresh fruit in the shaker before adding the other ingredients. For instance, add 2 sliced strawberries, muddle well, then continue making a keto strawberry margarita.\nHow Can I Make a Keto Margarita Mix?\nThis orange syrup is the perfect base for a custom keto margarita mix that just needs tequila. All you need to do is add lime juice to the syrup. It would be best to start small?maybe 1/2 ounce lime for 1/2 cup of syrup?then shake 1 3/4 ounces with a shot of tequila to see how it tastes. Add a little more lime to boost the tartness, or some of the leftover orange syrup for extra sweetness. Make notes of your adjustments so you can duplicate your ideal margarita mix. If you were to switch to a combination of lemon and lime, you'd have a low-sugar sour mix.\nHow Strong Is a Keto Margarita?\nEliminating the triple sec also lightens up the margarita.

Swirl the glass gently a few times to lightly mix the ingredients. Serve.\n3 Tequilas to Try in the Brave Bull\nThe simplicity of the Brave Bull calls for careful consideration of the ingredients. Most of you will choose Kahlua, so it's just a matter of choosing the tequila.\nThis doesn't have to be your best blanco tequila, but it also shouldn't be the worst on the liquor shelf. With only two ingredients in the recipe, a bad tequila will show and it might prevent you from enjoying the drink in its true light. Opt for a decent blanco (or upgrade to a reposado) that you wouldn't mind sipping on its own.\nCorazon Blanco Tequila - This is recommended for almost any tequila cocktail. Their aged tequilas are preferred and the richness of this brand from Los Altos region of Jalisco sets it apart from many of its counterparts. You will spend around $30 for a bottle and it is worth every penny.\nCorralejo Blanco Tequila - For less than $30, you will enjoy the crisp taste of this tequila in any of your favorite drinks. It is bottled straight off the copper pot still and is what the distiller calls 'The Truth' because it is so true to the flavor and spirit of tequila.\n1800 Silver Tequila - You can find this tequila in almost any liquor store and its priced right around $20. This is a fantastic choice for your everyday tequila drinks because it has a clean taste and is affordable for most budgets.\nHow Strong Is the Brave Bull?\nThe Brave Bull is made with minimal mixing in a similar way that you might enjoy a scotch on the rocks. That makes the dilution of the two liqueurs insignificant and because of that, this is a rather strong drink.\n\nIn fact, if you pour an 80-proof tequila, the Brave Bull comes down to just below the bottling proof, somewhere around 31 percent ABV (62 proof). It is a delicious drink but it's also one that can bite you if you're not careful.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/brave-bull-cocktail-recipe-759607

Freeze for at least 6 hours, though overnight is best.\nFor one large slushie or two small ones, combine 3 ice cubes and 6 frozen wine cubes with the berries and honey in a blender.\nBlend well, until mixed and slushy.\nPour into a chilled glass.\nGarnish with berries, serve, and enjoy.\nDoes Wine Freeze Well?\nWine has a low alcohol content and it will freeze to a certain extent. It doesn't get as solid as water but freezes to a semi-slushy consistency that maintains the cube shape rather well. The time needed to fully freeze wine depends on its alcohol content and your freezer temperature. In a chest freezer, a 10 percent ABV sparkling wine may freeze within six hours, while a stronger 13 percent ABV red wine will need a few more hours. A refrigerator's freezer is not as cold and the wine will need longer to freeze. In general, plan on letting the wine freeze overnight.\n\nHow to Change the Wine Slushie's Consistency\nBy using a combination of frozen and fresh fruits you can change the consistency of your wine slushie:\nUsing all frozen fruit creates a smoothie-like consistency.\nWhen made entirely of fresh fruit the slushy is more like an icy frozen cocktail.\nFor the best of both options, use fresh blackberries and raspberries with frozen strawberries.\nWith any of these options, refreezing the blended slushie will harden the mix and make it slushier. Between 3/4 and 1 cup of total fruit is about perfect for six 1-ounce wine cubes. Add more or less of any ingredient and blend again to suit your taste.\nTips\nThe wine can be frozen in any container, including cake or loaf pans and muffin tins. Ice cube trays make it convenient to pop out just the right amount for a drink or two.\nThe blended wine slushie can be frozen to serve later. Simply pour it into a freezer-safe container and freeze. Use a fork to scrape it out and transfer to glasses. Leftover slushie can be frozen in the glass, too.\nRecipe Variations\nThis wine slushy is designed to be thick and you can eat it with a spoon. To thin it out, add about 2 ounces of wine to the blender. Seltzer, club soda, or ginger ale can be blended into the slushie, too.\nIf you don't want to freeze the wine in advance, add more ice so it's more like a fros?. Blend about 5 ice cubes, 1 cup of wine, the fresh or frozen berries, and honey together. Add more ice for a thicker consistency.\nUse other blendable fruits. Blueberries, mangos, papaya, passion fruit, peaches, pineapple, and watermelon are all excellent choices.\nHow Strong Is a Wine Slushie?\nThe amount of alcohol in a wine slushie depends on a number of factors, including the strength of the wine. Generally, you can estimate that the ice and fruit dilute the wine by about half. For example, a slushie made with 13 percent ABV wine should fall in the 6 percent ABV range.\n25 Best Wine Cocktails""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/berry-wine-slushies-5079455

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nWhile Campari and bitters define this popular drink, it is important to choose the vodka wisely. Stick with top-shelf vodkas that are nice and clean, and you will have a great Campari cocktail.\nIf you are new to the taste of Campari, consider reversing the proportions, and pour more vodka than Campari at first. As you get used to the taste, slowly switch them back to the original proportions in the recipe.\nRecipe Variations\nCitrus vodka pairs well with Campari. You might like how it softens the bitter profile.\nYou can also add other citrus elements?particularly orange?to this drink. For instance, the Campari cosmo combines citrus vodka, orange juice, and triple sec with Campari to create a lovely drink.\nInstead of aromatic bitters, give orange bitters a try. Angostura also makes that flavor, though there are others that will work just as well. Regans' Orange Bitters No. 6 is an excellent option, and you can find orange bitters from Fee Brothers, Scrappy's, and The Bitter Truth.\nIf you'd like to serve this drink a little taller, strain it over ice into an old-fashioned glass and add a splash of club soda. Pouring as much as 3 ounces of soda results in a drink similar to the Americano.\nHow Strong Is a Campari Cocktail?\nThe Campari cocktail is a very strong drink, which is another good reason to keep it short. When made with 80-proof vodka, it will have an alcohol content of around 24 percent ABV (48 proof).

This may be too sour for some tastes and should be adjusted accordingly.\nThe prevalence of lemon juice also makes it crucial that fresh-squeezed juice is used and that it be properly measured using a jigger. Bottled lemon juice is either too sweet or too sour to find the delicate balance needed for a cocktail like this.\nThe last ingredient to consider is the sweetener. It is key to balancing out the sour aspect of any sour drink and should not be overlooked. Plain, granulated sugar can be added to the cocktail shaker while mixing though you may find that it does not dissolve completely and that is why bartenders rely on simple syrup in the bar.\nIf you have never made simple syrup, it is one of the easiest homemade bar ingredients out there. It is as easy as dissolving sugar in water as it heats and letting that simmer for a few minutes. In less than 10 minutes, you can have a fresh batch of syrup cooling and it is considerably cheaper than buying simple syrup at the liquor store.\nHow Strong Is the Canadian Sour?\nWhen an 80 proof whiskey is mixed into the cocktail as listed in the recipe, this drink is a casual 19 percent ABV (38 proof).

Top with ginger ale.\nServe and enjoy.\nHow Strong Is a Tamarind and Tequila?\nThe amount of ginger ale you end up pouring will affect the tamarind and tequila's alcohol content. On average, it's a pleasant and casual highball drink that weighs in around 8 percent ABV (16 proof), right in between the strength of beer and wine.\nTamarind in Cocktails\nThe tamarind tree produces pods that contain a unique fruit which is used in a variety of foods throughout the world including Indian, Mexican, and Mediterranean cuisines. It has a well-known sour flavor that becomes sweeter as the fruit ripens.\nWhen it comes to adding tamarind to drinks there are a few options:\nTamarind Nectar or Syrup: Often, the nectar is a tamarind concentrate that has water, sugar, and other additives. This is an ideal way to add tamarind to drinks that are stirred or shaken. You can find the nectar in many grocery stores, often in the juice aisle and sometimes in the whole foods or organic section.\nTamarind Paste or Concentrate: This is a thicker tamarind product that is good to use in blended drinks such as the tamarind margarita. The paste can be found in the international aisle of many supermarkets, in local gourmet shops, or online retailers. You can also process raw tamarind pods into a paste or puree yourself. It can be a daunting task, though well worth the effort, especially if you are also interested in cooking with it. \nAgua de Tamarindo: This is a popular drink in Mexico and can be made at home by boiling fresh tamarind pods in water until liquified, then combining it with sugar. Tamarindo also makes an appearance as a bottled soda, including one produced by Jarritos. These can often be found in Mexican markets.\nTamarind Flavor Pairings\nTamarind pairs very well with tequila and can also be used with vodka. The sweetness of rum and a sweeter whiskey may also work well with tamarind, though this may be a little trickier to find a balance.\nOther flavors that are nice with tamarind are ginger, coconut, chiles, lime, anise, and cinnamon. Tamarind tends to also work well with a variety of fruit juices, especially sweeter ones that balance the tamarind's sour profile.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/tamarind-and-tequila-recipe-760787

However, getting the same colors in that order is limited because of the density of the possible substitutes. There are a few options, though, and these may be helpful if you have one of them in your bar.\nIrish cream should make a good substitute for the top layer of cream. Specifically, Baileys is just a little lighter than cura?ao, so it will layer. Other brands not.\nFor the middle layer, you may be able to substitute an apricot liqueur for the cura?ao.

Give both a try and see which method you enjoy best.\nRecipe Variation\nIf you want a drink that\'s a little lower proof, substitute the liqueur for ginger syrup. It\'s an easy homemade ingredient if you have the fresh ginger root in the house. You will need to dissolve 1 cup of sugar in 3/4 cups of boiling water. Add 1 cup of sliced ginger, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Once off the heat, keep the syrup covered and let it steep until cool before straining out the ginger pieces.\nHow Strong Is a Gin and Ginger Martini?\nNot only does the gin and ginger martini have a wonderful bite of flavor, but it also has a nice alcohol kick. This one\'s sure to grab your attention and mixes up to an alcohol content around 29 percent ABV (58 proof), placing it among the strongest martinis you can make.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/la-coloniale-recipe-760094

Or, have a little extra fun with homemade peanut butter whiskey-infused ice cream.\nFor a bit more flavor, switch from vodka to whiskey.\nGive the frozen mudslide a minty twist by adding 1/2 tablespoon of chopped peppermint candy or 1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract to the blender. A 1/2 ounce of peppermint schnapps or cr?me de menthe are great alternatives (green cr?me de menthe will create a pale green shake).\nTo create a richer spiked mudslide malt, add three tablespoons of malted milk powder to the blender.\nHow Strong Is a Frozen Mudslide\nThe ice and ice cream knock this frozen cocktail's strength down considerably. When made with 80-proof vodka and the most common coffee and Irish cream liqueurs, it mixes up to an alcohol content of about 5 percent ABV (10 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nJamaican rum is known to be a bold, flavorful, and heavy style that's often made in pot stills and more tightly regulated than most rum. It's definitely worth pouring in the Embassy cocktail, so look for brands like Appleton Estate, Hampden, J Wray and Nephew, and Worthy Park.\nThe brandy you pour should be of equal quality to the rum, though it doesn't have to be the really good stuff. A nice V.S. or V.S.O.P. will do just fine here and in any brandy cocktail.\nCointreau is a premium brand of triple sec and recommended for this cocktail. If you're going to use a substitute, make sure it's of similar quality. Many of the least expensive triple sec options are too syrupy for a cocktail like this.\nFresh lime juice will finish this cocktail off perfectly. The average lime should yield about 1/2 ounce to 1 ounce of juice, so one fruit will be enough for one or two drinks.\nHow Strong Is an Embassy Cocktail?\nWhenever you come across a cocktail that's made almost entirely of liquor, you should expect it to be pretty strong. The Embassy definitely falls into that category. Cointreau is an 80-proof liqueur and if you were to pour brandy and rum of the same strength, this drink's alcohol content would be around 28 percent ABV (56 proof).

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nYou might be able to find red sugar in the cake decorating section of your local grocery store.\nIt's also easy to make the colored sugar at home. Simply add a few drops of red food coloring to a small pile (about 1/8 cup) of white granulated sugar and mix until you get a consistent color. It's best to let the sugar dry overnight, after which you'll likely need to break the hardened sugar cake back up into granules.\nAny sparkling wine can work in this martini. You might even want to choose a sparkling ros? because that style of wine tends to have strawberry notes that are a perfect complement to the raspberry.\nRecipe Variations\nAnother simple vampire's kiss cocktail skips the wine and brings cranberry juice into the mix. To make it, shake 1 1/2 ounces of vodka, 1 ounce of raspberry liqueur, and 1/2 ounce of cranberry juice, then strain it into the glass.\nYou can also switch to pomegranate vodka or use pomegranate liqueur instead of either the raspberry liqueur or cranberry juice. A cranberry-pomegranate juice blend works, too.\nPlay around with flavored vodkas. Vanilla and raspberry vodkas are excellent choices. You can also pour citrus vodka or try unique flavor combinations by using chocolate, pear, or pineapple vodkas.\nRum is a perfect option for this drink, so pour it instead of vodka if you like.\nWhat Are Fun Garnish Ideas for the Vampire's Kiss?\nIf you want to forego the sugar rim, a few raspberries make a nice garnish for this drink. Either add them to a cocktail skewer or simply let them float. For Halloween, you can add fun surprises to the cocktail. Place some (washed) fake vampire teeth in the bottom of the glass, or create spooky lychee eyeball garnishes to skewer and rest on the rim.\nHow Strong Is a Vampire's Kiss Martini?\nThere's no ice to dilute this cocktail, though it still mixes up to the average strength of fruity martinis. If you stick with all the recommended brands, your vampire's kiss martini will have an alcohol content of around 24 percent ABV (48 proof). To put that into perspective, drinking two of these is like taking a straight shot of vodka.\nGet Spooky With Midori and Blood-Orange Vodka in a Vampire's Kiss""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/vampire-kiss-martini-recipe-761200

A single orange yields 2 to 3 ounces of juice, so you'll have plenty for a few drinks.\nBe sure to serve this in a chilled glass.

Pour about 1/2 ounce of grapefruit juice, then top the drink with any light soda (e.g., club soda or lemon-lime soda).\nThe cantarito is a fabulous candidate for a big-batch cocktail. Mix the tequila and juices up in a pitcher, store it in the refrigerator, then top the glasses with soda when you're ready for a drink.\nHow Strong Is a Cantarito?\nEstimating the alcohol content of soda-topped mixed drinks is never precise.

They don\'t always agree, though this recipe is one of the more common versions you\'ll find.\nA few suggest replacing the two juices with 1/2 ounce of sour mix. This makes sense because the syrup is typically flavored with lemon and lime, though the extra sugar will result in a sweeter drink.\nSome recipes simply call for whiskey rather than the fruity whiskey blend of Southern Comfort. To keep the Southern charm, choose something regional like Tennessee whiskey or Kentucky bourbon (well-crafted moonshine would be appropriate as well). You\'ll also find that some of these use blue cura?ao, so while the orange accent remains, the drink will be a completely different color.\nHow Strong Is a Rhett Butler Cocktail?\nThe Rhett Butler is the more robust of the two ""Gone With the Wind"" cocktails. That\'s rather fitting given the character\'s bolder personality. Yet, Southern Comfort is bottled at a variety of strengths: 100-proof, 70-proof, and 42-proof. Taking the middle ground, the drink shakes up to 21 percent ABV (42 proof).

Drambuie or B?renj?ger are two great options and the extra alcohol will add a nice punch to the drink.\nYou can also accent this recipe with complementary flavors, such as hazelnut from a liqueur like Frangelico or the almond flavor of amaretto. Adding a shot of Benedictine is always a great option because it's a natural pairing for brandy.\nHow Strong Is a Snow Honey?\nThe snow honey mixes up to a soothing and pleasant strength. When made with an 80-proof brandy and 4 ounces of milk, it will be just 10 percent ABV (20 proof).""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/snow-honey-cocktail-recipe-759406

No extra steps are involved because you can do it in the same shaker while mixing up the martini. Simply add 1 1/4 ounces of milk and an egg yolk to the shaker along with the vodka and amaretto. Shake it vigorously for 30 seconds.\nYou can also use leftover homemade eggnog or vegan eggnog in this martini recipe.\nSwitch out the amaretto for Frangelico for a slightly different nutty flavor.\nGo back to a traditional eggnog base liquor if you prefer one over vodka. This martini tastes great with brandy, rum, or whiskey and you can find vanilla-flavored versions of all three.\nFor a lighter martini with a different flavor profile, use a cinnamon syrup as an amaretto substitute. Ginger syrup is another great option.\nYou can also dress up the martini by adding a cinnamon-sugar rim before straining the cocktail.\nHow Strong Is an Eggnog Martini?\nThis martini is lighter than most. In fact, it's about the same strength as a glass of wine, weighing in around 15 percent ABV (30 proof).

Fill with ice.\nShake vigorously for 30 seconds.\nStrain into a chilled cocktail glass.\nRaw Egg Warning\nConsuming raw and lightly-cooked eggs poses a risk of food-borne illness.\nTips\nMany people prefer to begin mixing egg drinks with a ""dry shake,"" especially when it includes egg white only because it increases the froth. It\'s a simple technique: shake the ingredients without ice for about 10 seconds, then fill the shaker with ice and shake for 30 seconds.\nYou know that the drink is well shaken when your arms hurt and the cocktail shaker gets really frosty on the outside.\nBe sure that the egg you\'re using is fresh. A quick test can give you a clue: drop the egg into a glass of water and if it sinks, it\'s fresh. Eggs that float should be discarded.\nWith a cocktail as simple as this, be sure to choose a top-shelf brandy.\nAnisette is a style of anise-flavored liqueur that\'s made by a number of brands. Again, quality is a big consideration; good choices for a cocktail like the Baltimore bracer include Luxardo, Marie Brizard, and Norseman.\nRecipe Variations\nIf you do not have anisette, any other anise-flavored liqueur will do. The list of viable substitutes includes absinthe, Herbsaint, ouzo, pastis, sambuca, and Pernod. Galliano also has a slight anise taste though vanilla is its other dominant flavor and both are backed by almost 30 other herbs.\nTry a flavored brandy substitute over the standard which is distilled from grapes. Apple, peach, and pear brandies should all pair nicely with anise. When shopping for these brandies, look for an eau-de-vie (distilled from the fruit juice) rather than a sweetened liqueur with (possibly) artificial flavoring.\nHow Strong Is a Baltimore Bracer?\nAs you might expect from a drink that\'s almost entirely made of alcohol, the Baltimore bracer is pretty strong. When mixed with the average brandy and anisette, it should shake up to have an alcohol content around 22 percent ABV (44 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/baltimore-bracer-recipe-759389

Serve and enjoy.\nWhat Herbs Are in Chartreuse?\nCarthusian monks continue to produce Chartreuse based on centuries-old secret recipes. Both green and yellow Chartreuse are flavored with around 130 different botanicals, including herbs and spices. Each liqueur has citrus notes, but only a few ingredients are disclosed: Green Chartreuse is dominated by clove, rosemary, and thyme, whereas yellow Chartreuse features anise, honey, saffron, and violet.\nTips\nJust like any liquor-only martini, you may prefer to stir this cocktail. Experiment with the two methods to see which you enjoy most.\nTop-shelf gin is highly recommended for the Chartreuse martini. London dry gins are great choices, offering a classic juniper-forward profile that works very well against Chartreuse. Many craft gins don\'t follow the traditional flavor profile but would excel in this cocktail as well.\nMake sure that your dry vermouth is not outdated. Once a bottle is open, it has a shelf life of just two to three months in the refrigerator. If your vermouth doesn\'t fit any of that description, it\'s time to replace it.\nRecipe Variations\nMake the Chartreuse martini ""dirty"" by adding a little olive juice. For a more subtle twist, give it the essence of olives by adding a few olives as a garnish.\nYellow Chartreuse will work just as well as its green counterpart in the martini. The two liqueurs use different flavoring ingredients, so the drink\'s taste will change.\nDoes Chartreuse Need to Be Refrigerated?\nChartreuse is a high-proof, lightly sweetened liqueur, so it has a nearly indefinite shelf life. Open bottles do not require refrigeration but should be kept in a cool place out of direct sunlight.\nHow Strong Is a Chartreuse Martini?\nGreen Chartreuse is bottled at 110 proof (55 percent ABV). It is not a light liqueur and makes this a potent drink, which is why it\'s served at just 3 ounces. Falling in line with similar martinis, this cocktail should be in the 32 percent ABV (64 proof) range.\nThe Last Word Is a Brilliant Chartreuse Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/chartreuse-martini-recipe-760068

Bols does make a cr?me de noyaux that is made from apricot kernels. Either is a good option if your local liquor store stocks it.\n\nBarring that, there are two elements of cr?me de noyaux that you can duplicate if you can\'t find the real deal: the taste or the color. Unless you make your own, it is nearly impossible to get both in your pink squirrel. We have listed potential substitutes for this liqueur below:\nAmaretto: Cr?me de noyaux is like amaretto. Both liqueurs have the same almond flavor despite the fact that neither is made from almonds. Instead, cr?me de noyaux is made from the pits (or stones) of apricots, peaches, plums, and other ""stone"" fruits. Noyaux is French for ""stone"" or ""kernel,"" so the name makes sense. If you use amaretto, the almond flavor will be nearly the same, but the drink will be a milky brown color. To get the pink color, a drop of food coloring in the cocktail shaker will do.\nGrenadine: If all you want is the plush pink color, use grenadine in place of the cr?me de noyaux. The fruity chocolate flavor is delicious, but it is entirely different than the almond-chocolate the pink squirrel was designed for.\nTip\nBeyond popularity, there are other issues surrounding cr?me de noyaux. One that scares many drinkers away is the cyanide potential. There is a compound in the noyaux that turns into hydrogen cyanide when digested. The majority of the time, the quantities are too small to be harmful and nothing to worry about. It is, however, something to be aware of.\nCr?me de Noyaux Facts\nBright red, almond-flavored liqueur made from the kernels of apricots and other stone fruits.\nSometimes spelled cr?me de noyau.\nPronounced: km de not-yew.\n24 to 30 percent alcohol by volume (48 to 60 proof).\nHow Strong Is the Pink Squirrel?\nThe pink squirrel is a gentle, low-proof cocktail. If we were to choose a 48-proof option for both liqueurs, this drink would weigh in at just 10 percent ABV (20 proof).']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pink-squirrel-cocktail-recipe-759770

Serve and enjoy.\nTips\nIf you want to substitute the gin with a different brand, make sure it's comparable in quality to Beefeater. This is designed to be a high-class aperitif cocktail and deserves the best gin you can afford.\nProsecco is an Italian sparkling wine that's perfect for cocktails. Not only is it a great tasting mixer, but it's also generally less expensive than Champagne. That said, almost any sparkling wine will make a fine Ruby Negroni.\nRaspberry syrup can often be found within the coffee sweeteners of grocery stores. Amoretti and Torani are two well-known brands that offer the flavored syrup.\nYou can also make your own raspberry syrup at home. It's just like the strawberry syrup recipe, but you will want to use 1 cup of fresh or frozen raspberries. To make it, dissolve one cup of sugar into 1 cup of boiling water. Add the raspberries, mash them, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let the syrup cool and infuse for 2 hours, then strain out the fruit. The bottled syrup will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator.\nRecipe Variations\nTawny port tends to be a little less sweet than a ruby port, which is used more often in cocktails. This recipe can use either style of port, depending on whether you enjoy a sweeter or a drier drink.\nInstead of raspberry syrup, you can use a raspberry liqueur such as Chambord if you like.\nHow Strong Is a Ruby Negroni?\nThe Ruby Negroni is filled with alcohol, though most of its volume is made up of wine. That means that it's a little gentler than you might expect?though it's not necessarily a low-proof cocktail. In general, this one should mix up to an alcohol content around 17 percent ABV (34 proof), which is slightly stronger than the average glass of wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/ruby-negroni-recipe-760116

Some are even frozen slushy drinks. If you plan to order a sneaky Pete at a bar, you should specify exactly what you expect. You may also end up in a debate with your guests over whether this cocktail is what they were envisioning for a sneaky Pete.\nWhat Is Rye Whiskey?\nRye whiskey from the U.S. is made with a mash of at least 51 percent rye. George Washington made rye whiskey on his Mount Vernon estate, and today a craft distillery produces it there. Rye whiskey has a spicier or fruitier flavor than bourbon, which is also sweeter than rye. Canadian rye whisky is also available but doesn\'t have a set percentage of rye required. As a result, Canadian ryes may have far more corn and very little rye.\nWhat Is Coffee Liqueur?\nThe most popular brands of coffee liqueurs are made with rum, sugar, vanilla, and coffee. It is very easy to make your own coffee liqueur with cold-brewed coffee, sugar, and a vanilla bean. You can make it with rum or with vodka. It\'s best to let it age for two weeks before enjoying it.\nHow Strong Is the Sneaky Pete?\nLet\'s assume that you use a coffee liqueur that is 20 percent ABV and an 80-proof whiskey to mix up your sneaky Pete. In this case, you can estimate the drink to have an alcohol content of around 9 percent ABV (18 proof).

It is watery compared to American yogurt, somewhat similar to kefir or lassi. You can try an American yogurt drink if you don't have access to the Korean yogurt, as long as it's not too thick. You can use the plain (regular) flavor, but people do use peach, strawberry, orange, melon, lychee, mango, and other fruit varieties as well. Any of these flavors can be used to make your yogurt soju cocktail. In fact, there are numerous variations on the basic recipe, some of which include fruit-based garnishes.\nHow Strong Is a Yogurt Soju Cocktail?\nSoju is a common, highly potent alcoholic beverage in Korea. It's made by fermenting and then distilling a mixture that contains mainly rice and a blend of wheat, barley, and even sweet potatoes and is clear and mainly tasteless, much like vodka. Soju's alcohol percentage can range greatly, from 16 to 45 percent (32 to 90 proof, also similar to vodka). Assuming the cocktail is mixed using a 60 proof soju, it clocks in at a relatively light 10 percent or 20 proof, similar to a glass of white wine.\nWhat Mixes Well With Soju?\nSoju is often compared to vodka because of its mild taste and clear color. It can be used in similar cocktails and mixed with fruit juices, sodas, and more.

Glass shot cups work if you offer guests small spoons to scoop the jello out.\nAdding more alcohol may prevent the gelatin from setting up. Generally, the total volume of liquor should not exceed 4 ounces in any jello shot recipe.\nDon't overdo the lime juice either. Fresh is best, and too much of any lime juice can make the shot bitter.\nThe unflavored gelatin helps solidify the mix and is most useful if you plan to unmold the jello shots. Feel free to skip it if you're serving them directly in cups.\nIf you plan to use molds or some fancy presentation, do a test batch before the party. A little experimentation is needed for each type of mold, and you'll learn tricks to get the cleanest look. You may need to reduce the liquid or add more unflavored gelatin, for instance. Spray molds with cooking spray before filling so the gelatin is easier to remove.\nRecipe Variations\nThis jello shot can take on the flavor of mango, pineapple, raspberry, strawberry, or whatever your heart desires.

Banana liqueur brings gold into the color scheme, cherry liqueur forms the red middle, and UV Blue Vodka finishes it off perfectly.\nHow Strong Is the Fourth of July Shooter?\nThere is no mixing this drink, so there's no water to dilute it. And while grenadine is alcohol free and that helps tame this shooter down a bit, it still packs a punch and the sweet taste can be deceiving. In the end, you'll create a shot with an alcohol content of 23 percent ABV (46 proof). That makes the Fourth of July half the strength of a shot of tequila.

Pour the sparkling wine into a small glass on the side. Serve, following each drink of the cocktail with a sip of wine. Enjoy.\nTips\nAs with many martinis, choosing quality ingredients is highly recommended for the best flavor. Fresh passion fruit puree and vanilla sugar and top-shelf vanilla vodka and passion fruit liqueur will produce a better tasting cocktail. For the wine, choose a nice bottle; prosecco is often less expensive than French Champagne.\nTo quickly make vanilla sugar, combine 1/4 to 1/2 cup of white sugar with the seeds of one vanilla bean. Combine them using a mortar and pestle or food processor. In a pinch, it can also be mixed with a fork. The sugar will pick up more vanilla flavor the longer you let it set, though this concentrated formula can be used right away. Store extra in an airtight container at room temperature.\nThere are a number of options for purchasing passion fruit puree. It\'s produced by gourmet food companies and those that specialize in nonalcoholic cocktail mixers (e.g., Finest Call, Amoretti). Look for it in specialty food stores or well-stocked liquor stores; it\'s also easy to find online.\nPasso? is one of the best-known passion fruit liqueurs. Other brands that specialize in fruit liqueurs, including Aliz?, Bols, and Giffard, offer the flavor as well.\nRecipe Variations\nGarnish the cocktail with a lemon twist if you can\'t find fresh passion fruit.\nUse unflavored vodka if you prefer.\nSkip the puree and pour 2 ounces each of vodka and passion fruit liqueur instead.\nUse 3/4 to 1 ounce of vanilla syrup as a substitute for the vanilla sugar.\nMany people enjoy adding extra fruit flavors to the pornstar martini. Try it with 1 1/2 ounces of either passion fruit liqueur or puree, then add 1/2 ounce of pineapple or apple juice.\nSome recipes call for a splash of either lemon or lime juice. This may create a drink that\'s too tart when made with fresh passion fruit but might balance out the drink when made with passion fruit liqueur alone or a sweetened puree.\nHow to Make a Passion Fruit Pur?e\nFresh passion fruit may not be readily available everywhere, but it\'s easy to make into a puree. For one martini, you\'ll need about four passion fruits?this is also the minimum that the average blender can work with because there\'s not much inside the small fruit.\nCut each passion fruit in half on a plate to capture the juices.\nScrape the pulp and seeds out of the shells and into the blender pitcher along with any remnants on the plate.\nBlend for about 2 minutes until it\'s an even consistency.\nPour the contents through a fine-mesh strainer, using a spoon or spatula to shuffle it around to release more of the juicy puree from the seeds. Some tiny pieces of seed will fall through; not only are they edible, but the black specks add to the cocktail\'s presentation.\nUse in the cocktail and refrigerate any extra in a sealed container.\nWhy Is It Called a Pornstar Martini?\nAn unusual name, the pornstar martini was originally named after a club in Cape Town, South Africa, and known as the ""maverick martini."" The recipe was created in the early 2000s by Douglas Ankrah, founder of the London Academy of Bartending. Ankrah opened London\'s Townhouse bar in 2002, and the cocktail was one of the featured drinks on the menu. It was not until he renamed it as the pornstar martini that it really took off. Ankrah has said that he thought the drink looked like something a porn star would drink.\nHow Do You Drink a Pornstar Martini?\nIt\'s traditional to drink a pornstar martini by first taking a sip of the cocktail followed by a small sip of sparkling wine. Enjoy at your leisure, sipping the wine after each drink of cocktail.\nHow Strong Is a Pornstar Martini?\nEven when you factor in the sparkling wine, the pornstar martini is not much stronger than the wine itself. Its lower alcohol content is attributed to the fact that vanilla vodka is most often 70 proof and the main cocktail contains a high volume of nonalcoholic fruit puree. On average, the two-part drink will weigh in around 15 percent ABV (30 proof). It is one of the lower-proof ""martinis,"" making it tempting to enjoy a second round. Just keep in mind that some people find that the wine\'s carbonation speeds up intoxication.\nEnjoy Passion Fruit in the Classic Hurricane Cocktail']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/pornstar-martini-recipe-5078708

Serve and enjoy.\nThe Base Spirit: This recipe was created by Bombay Sapphire and it really is a lovely gin for the cocktail. The botanicals are nicely balanced and soft enough to allow the lavender to peak through the mix. Yet, it is not the only gin that will work here.\nFeel free to test your favorite gins in this cocktail as it is as versatile as the Tom Collins. Many of the newer, non-traditional gins like Hendrick's and especially Aviation are perfect candidates as well.\nBeyond the gin, you can switch out the base spirit for another liquor if you like. If you're a fan of vodka, try that. Rum and tequila will also work nicely, and you might even find the right whiskey with a very soft profile (i.e., a blended Canadian whiskey) that will not overpower the lavender. In true 'Collins' drink fashion, the choices are endless.\nThe Herbal Syrup: Use this recipe and the syrup as inspiration for bringing your favorite herbs into the Collins formula. Rosemary or a blend of lavender and rosemary are two places to begin but don't stop there.\nGive it more of a citrus herbal taste with a syrup infusion of lemongrass or lemon balm.\nTurn the drink into a refreshing cooler with a mint simple syrup.\nTake more of a savory approach with a basil syrup or a parsley-lemon syrup.\nChoose another soft floral by creating a chamomile syrup with a hint of orange peel.\nEssentially, if you can grow a herb in your garden, it has strong potential in a syrup and in this drink.\nHow Strong Is the Lavender Sapphire Collins?\nAs with most highball mixed drinks, the Lavender Sapphire Collins is a very gentle cocktail. The high volume of soda helps mellow it out despite the use of a 94-proof gin. On average, this cocktail weighs in at around 11 percent ABV (22 proof), which is about the same as your average wine.""]",https://www.thespruceeats.com/lavender-sapphire-collins-760096

The bottled versions are often sweetened and can throw off the drink's flavor balance.\nFor the best Midori sour, choose a mid-range vodka that you would enjoy drinking on its own.\nRecipe Variations\nTo make a ready-to-serve pitcher of Midori sours, increase the ingredients in proportion to the number of servings needed. For instance, to serve six people, mix nine ounces (1 1/8 cups) of melon liqueur, six ounces (3/4 cup) of vodka, and three ounces each of the lemon and lime juices in a pitcher. Keep chilled, then pour about 3 1/2 ounces of the juice mix over ice into each glass before topping it off with chilled club soda and adding the garnish.\nWhen you want a more relaxed mixed drink, skip the vodka entirely to reduce the ABV.\nReplace the lemon and lime juices with a homemade sour mix. When mixed with the melon liqueur, this citrus-flavored syrup can create a drink that's too sweet, so pour just 1/2 to 3/4 ounce of sour mix.\nFor a subtly sweeter cocktail, switch from club soda to lemon-lime soda or ginger ale.\nGive the Midori sour a quick twist by pouring tequila instead of vodka.\nIf you prefer a martini version, try the Grinch recipe which uses melon liqueur, lemon juice, and simple syrup.\nHow Strong Is the Midori Sour?\nEven with a shot of 80-proof vodka, the soda ensures that the Midori sour is a relatively low-proof cocktail. Typically, this drink mixes up to an alcohol content of around 10 percent ABV (20 proof).

1013,Vodka Cranberry Syringe Shot,https://www.thespruceeats.com/thmb/JOStsdHau1kjw_Cptb3umvtTQ20=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/vodka-cranberry-syringe-shooter-759252-030-c70aabba2eae4fe495e4b5aeb5fbaba9.jpg,3 mins,"[{'amount': '4', 'unit': 'ounces', 'name': 'lemon-lime soda'}, {'amount': '1', 'unit': 'ounce', 'name': 'cranberry vodka'}]","['Gather the ingredients.\nFill a pint glass (or other tall glass) half-way with chilled soda and draw 1 ounce of vodka into a syringe.\nPlace the vodka-filled syringe into the soda. To take the shot, the drinker shoots the syringe directly into their mouth then chases it with the soda. Or, the shot can be injected into the glass of soda and everything is drunk quickly. Enjoy.\nTips\nCranberry vodka is made by a few different brands; some are red while others are clear.\nYou can also make your own cranberry-infused vodka with fresh or frozen cranberries. It\'s best to chop the berries either by hand or in a food processor to maximize the flavor. Use about 1 1/2 cups of cranberries for a 750-milliliter bottle of vodka and let it infuse for 3 to 4 weeks before straining out the berries.\nRecipe Variations\nMake this shot without cranberry vodka. Use regular vodka (or any flavor) instead and mix it with an equal part of cranberry juice. It will cut the alcohol content in half while retaining the vodka cranberry flavor.\nWill you have a black light at the party? Switch the soda out for tonic water. Quinine is the essential ingredient in tonic and it makes the soda glow under black light. Displaying the syringes in glowing water is a pretty cool effect that will add to the party\'s atmosphere.\nSyringe Shots\nThe vodka-filled syringe is the best part of this shot and the syringes are readily available. Most party stores will carry them, particularly around Halloween, because they have become a popular alternative to serving jello shots in plastic cups.\nThe syringes that are designed specifically for party shots are larger than those for medical uses and there are no needles, so they\'re perfectly safe. Most will hold between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 ounces and many have caps so you can fill them before the party. Because this shooter is liquid and not gelatin, that\'s a very important feature to look for in the syringes you buy; without the lid, the vodka will drip out.\nBe sure to rinse the syringes before using them to remove any manufacturing particles. Also, the sooner you clean them out after taking the shot, the easier it will be. During the party, consider having a bowl or bucket of water to drop them into and let them soak once your guests are done.\nHow Strong Is a Vodka Cranberry Syringe Shot?\nSimilar to ""bomb"" shots, with the vodka cranberry syringe shot you\'re drinking a straight shot of vodka then chasing it. Most flavored vodkas are bottled at 70 proof, so that will be the strength of the shot on its own. However, the soda will dilute it (either in your stomach or the glass, depending on how to shoot it), so the effect could be more like drinking a 7 percent ABV (14 proof) drink.']",https://www.thespruceeats.com/bloody-shirley-temple-syringe-shooter-759252

That said, there are good and inexpensive brands available that are perfect for drinks like this.\nThe point is that this is a drink where you can save some cash.

The total amount of liquor adds up to just 2 1/2 ounces. Alcohol does make up the majority of the drink, but reality sets in when you run the numbers.\nWith 80-proof spirits and a 30-proof cura?ao, the average electric iced tea weighs in at around 21% alcohol by volume (42 proof).

Good options are an Albarino or Verdejo, but you can also try a Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, or Vinho Verde, a Portuguese wine.\nThe two important things to remember when choosing a wine for sangria are that it needs to be dry and un-oaked, and it should not be expensive and top-of-the-line. You want the wine to be something you would drink on its own, but since you are adding juice and fruit and soda, it doesn't need to be high-end.\nSince sangria is also made with red wine, feel free to substitute if you prefer; just keep the two rules in mind when choosing the wine.\nYou can eliminate the strawberries if you want to keep the focus on blueberries. Just increase the quantity of the blueberries.\nRecipe Variations\nThis recipe calls for blueberry juice, which may be tricky to find at your local grocery store (Ocean Spray is a popular brand to look for). You can substitute grape juice if need be.\nYou can use lemonade or pink lemonade in place of the blueberry juice, though this will change the taste of the drink significantly.\nOther Sangria Recipes\nOnce the warm weather arrives it seems only fitting to sip a cocktail that features fresh fruit.

Making Scuppernong wine is traditional for many families in the states where these grapes originated.\nScuppernong is a type of muscadine grape.

There are many midrange rye whiskeys available that work perfectly.\nThe longer the rock candy sits in the whiskey, the more the flavors will meld. It is important to test the infusion periodically until it gets to your desired flavor intensity.\nThe finished rock and rye should be bottled under a tight seal. The original whiskey bottle works well, as does a Mason jar or any glass bottle that seals out air. \nOnce strained and bottled, rock and rye keeps well for up to two months in the refrigerator. \nRecipe Variations\nUse orange slices instead of lemon or a combination of the two citrus fruits.\nA few pineapple chunks are a good alternative to the apricot.\nRather than rock candy, many modern rock and rye recipes use honey, simple syrup, or a flavored syrup (syrup from a jar of high-end cherries is popular). Use 2 to 3 tablespoons and stir it into the whiskey.\nHow Strong Is Rock and Rye?\nThe rock candy will infuse its sweetness into the whiskey and, much like a liqueur, this will cut the alcohol content down. However, it\'s not going to be significant and will vary from one batch to the next.
